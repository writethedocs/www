## Write the Docs website

This is the code that powers [www.writethedocs.org](http://www.writethedocs.org). It contains information
about the Write the Docs group, as well as information about writing documentation.

The repo is still in its early stages; feel free to contribute information that you might want to share with the community. To contribute to the Write the Docs website, famililarize yourself with the [Sphinx site generator](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/index.html).

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install everything you need to generate the site locally.

Run `make html` in the `docs` directory to generate a local version of the site in
`docs/_build/html/`.

The Write the Docs website is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/writethedocs-www).
