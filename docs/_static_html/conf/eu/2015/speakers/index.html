    <h4>Tested and Correct, How to Make Sure Your Documentation Keeps Working</h4>

    <p>When you are writing documentation for software, a top priority is surely
      that what you write is correct. That is, the examples you provide give the
      output you say they will. Or perhaps it is that the links in your
      documentation link to an expected page. Usually this is done with manual
      testing at the time of writing. Your organisation may have practices in
      place to make sure that these examples don&#39;t get too out of date - maybe
      someone checks them periodically, maybe code review comes with comments like
      &#34;I remember that this part of the code is used in an example on Page 37 of
      our docs, change it&#34;. But these methods are tedious and flawed.  This talk
      will give examples from my work as a software engineer in creating tested
      snippets for documentation which are linked to the code they represent. It
      will show how using techniques traditionally reserved for software testing
      can ease the burden of keeping documentation up to date.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <h4>The quest for scientific credit for software documentation</h4>

    <p>Modern geoscientific research relies heavily on numerical computations
      involving complex software developed by physicists or chemists. It would
      seem that scientists should be well versed in ways of documenting and
      explaining their research. Yet, when it comes to the documentation of
      scientific software projects, one soon realises that scientific wisdom is
      spread mostly by LaTeX and that the word &#39;documentation&#39; starts to mean
      something completely different.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Writing a documentation for a
      scientific project can be quite challenging. There are not that many
      examples of well-documented open-source geoscientific numerical modelling
      software projects to drew the inspiration from. Even though the scientific
      results should be reproducible, mechanisms that reward those who deliver
      well documented software are still to become widespread. The scientists are
      judged basing on the number of peer-reviewed papers they publish, therefore
      investing the time solely to offer the documentation is difficult. The
      documentation should include the actual mathematical equations and theory
      behind the software, figures documenting the scientific results as well as
      code listings and usage examples. The target audience may have a strong
      background in science, computer science, both or neither.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <h4>Before the docs: writing for user interfaces</h4>

    <p>Good documentation is important, but it should be your last resort. You
      need to help users before they reach the docs - in the user interface
      itself.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In this talk, I&#39;ll discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;strategies for writing microcopy when you’re short on space&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;what to explain in the UI, and what to save for the documentation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;how to pick the right style of embedded help&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;what makes a great error message (and a terrible one)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;... with plenty of real-world examples of doing it right and wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

    <h4>Documenting your Story - Crafting a good presentation</h4>

    <p>Whilst not a part of the core documentation of projects, presentations
      and delivering them to the public are an essential part of spreading the
      word about what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;They need to be as equally consistent with your messaging and style
      guides, get to a key point effectively and also allow the presenter to
      inject some personality.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This is especially hard with technical projects where the &#39;story&#39; is
      either hard to explain or can&#39;t just end up sounding like a sales pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In this presentation I will explore and explain my experiences as an
      advocate for several open source projects, audience reactions to those
      presentations and how I have iterated my presentations in sync with changes
      to product and branding.&lt;/p&gt;

    <h4>All roads might not lead to docs</h4>

    <p>Documentation may not have a reputation as a creative enterprise, but
       we know that filling the role of documentarian requires creative problem solving
       - especially in figuring how to create, display, and maintain a reliable collection
       of docs.&lt;/p&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;If your goal is clear - we need (better) docs - then creativity comes in discovering
       how to get there. But creative problem solving has an important role to play in determining
       whether you&#39;ve got the right goal: are docs the answer?&lt;/p&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;This talk starts with framing the common types of needs that docs can meet: informing,
       learning, referencing, persuading, and engaging. With examples for each, we&#39;ll see how
       creative thinking - mixed with data and some knowledge of human behavior - can shape problem
       statements that lead to better solutions, which aren&#39;t always the traditional doc. It&#39;s about
       making sure that we, as documentarians, aren&#39;t just writing - we&#39;re shaping the discussion about
       when and how docs make our teams, organizations, and communities better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <h4>Screencasting 101</h4>

    <p>As a writer, it's been tough for me to admit that not everyone wants to
      read my carefully written documentation. While people will read, not
      everyone learns by reading the docs. Since my goal is to make sure my
      documentation can meet as many learning styles as possible, that has meant
      spreading my documentarian wings and bridging out from only writing the docs
      into recording them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Part of my documentation journey has been learning how to create
      screencasts and I want to share that knowledge with everyone. From picking
      the right topics, to outlining, to writing a script (yes I promise, there is
      still writing involved), to how to record your audio and video, I&#39;ll cover
      it all. You don&#39;t need to be a professional voice actor or videographer to
      create a screencast, even a writer can create something wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

    <h4>How to Write an Email</h4>

    <p>Nobody loves email. Nobody really even likes email. In fact email can
      totally suck and it is here to stay. Despite how we feel about it, we have
      to deal with email almost every single day. Fortunately we can improve email
      as a whole by learning how to write email that sucks just a little bit less
      -- not that you write bad emails.. this talk is for your... friend. Yeah,
      this talk is for your friends that really need to setup up their email
      game.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In addition to email this talk will explore some fundamental
      misunderstandings that people have with modes of online communication and
      how to correct these misunderstandings. Like how to craft a good Tweet,
      Facebook Post, and Instant Messaging interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This is not meant to be a tutorial but rather a conceptual guide for how
      to think about on-line communication and how to correct some common faults
      we share as members of the on-line community. The Internet isn&#39;t going away
      anytime soon, and the amount we communicate over it is not going to diminish
      anytime soon either. This talk attempts to teach one how to make digital
      communication as painless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <h4>Whatchamacallit: Controlled Vocabularies for Technical Writers</h4>

    <p>An everyday dilemma in technical communication: What do you call that
      “thing”? Whether you ask developers, marketing folks or users, you often get
      very different views.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Along with user interfaces, documentation helps all stakeholders align
      their mental model of a product. Terminology plays a key role, and a
      controlled vocabulary is an ace up the technical writer&#39;s sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Controlled vocabularies are basically lists of concepts and the
      relationships between them. Beyond consistent naming, they are about
      structuring, categorizing and retrieving content. For example, you can use a
      vocabulary as a basis for documentation plans, tables of content, a help
      site&#39;s navigation, search filters, or even to organize test cases.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will share ways to create and maintain various types of
      vocabularies, and explain what each type is useful for. You can start with a
      flat list of terms and expand it into a glossary, a thesaurus, a taxonomy,
      or even a full-fledge ontology.&lt;/p&gt;

    <h4>Gardening Open Docs</h4>

    <p>With about 1000 different editors each month, the Mozilla Developer
      Network (MDN) documentation Web site for Open Web technologies is a
      trafficked wiki with edits of all kind of quality: perfect text from
      seasoned professional writers to rough notes by teen-aged technology
      learners.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In this talk, we are going to explore how to keep this doc garden clean,
      how the diversity of editors influence its evolution, and how we find our
      way through treacherous jungles to well-maintained royal gardens.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This is about improving quality, working with diverse communities,
      fostering innovation, and carnivorous plants.&lt;/p&gt;

    <h4>Generating docs from APIs</h4>

    <p>APIs define contracts between a service and a client, and with the rise
      of representation languages like Swagger, Apiary, and RAML, these contracts
      can be consumed programmatically and adapted easily into our
      codebases. Other tools like JSON Schema also contribute to this idea of
      integration between service and client.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;But what about our documentation? If API contracts can be assimilated
      into software, surely it can drive our documentation too? In this talk, I
      want to introduce some of the techniques I&#39;ve used on past projects that
      allow exactly that. By using remote schemas to generate software, it also
      allows us to generate working documentation that is always relevant and
      never out of date. Apart from accuracy, we also get the added benefits of
      reduced development time, reduced effort, and reduced duplication. We can
      all of this by documenting once, and re-using across multiple projects!&lt;/p&gt;

    <h4>Back to the Future: What Can Documentarians Learn From The Past?</h4>

    <p>The world of software development rightly demands an emphasis on the new
      and the innovative -- on doing things differently from how they’ve been
      done. The assumption is that newer is (almost) always better. But if we look
      only to the present and the future, we risk reinventing the wheel, failing
      to understand that we are all built on tradition, failing to learn
      everything that we could from the past.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;This talk shows how documentarians can find inspiration in the past,
      build on it, and move forward. It tells some of these stories, and shows
      what they meant in historical context:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;ul&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;The pre-history and dawn of software documentation -- how technical
      writers were hired, how they worked, what they made, the challenges they
      faced, and how their solutions continue to inform the work we do today&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;The much longer history of teaching engineers to write documentation&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;Efforts to make technical writing into an independent profession&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;/ul&gt;

    <h4>Free Your Mind and Your Docs Will Follow</h4>

    <p>As documentarians, we face plenty of hurdles to delivering what we are
      assigned (harried and inaccessible subject matter experts, barely
      functioning builds, sketchy doc infrastructure, etc.). But there are also
      the obstacles that keep us from writing the docs we *want*, and those are
      largely ingrained in our companies&#39; processes and our own heads.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;We pay lip service to &#34;the user&#34; but then subordinate that to concerns of
      structure, consistency, and stylistic conventions. The result is often docs
      that are internally consistent and satisfy the editorial, translation, and
      production teams for their economy and re-usability but are so dry and
      product-centered that they fail to connect with the most important audience
      - actual human beings.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I&#39;ll talk about ways to overcome burdensome
      organizational processes and our own timidity to create room for the
      inspiration and creativity needed to bring the docs&#39; subject alive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <h4>Judas Priest Ate My Scrum Master</h4>

    <p>Community Management in Free Software communities is still an emerging
      field and has produced a spectrum of practitioners: from master-manipulators
      of social media, to those more focused on metrics and data as a means to
      driving process. Either way, the state of the art is still largely driven by
      the needs of technical contributors to projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Good documentation is a crucial component in a software product and yet
      often technical writers are overlooked as important stakeholders of the
      process. Within the community, there are undoubtedly common problems between
      engineers and technical writers. Software Engineering is full of laws; can
      we show that these laws apply to technical writers as a means to help bridge
      the chasm between developers and technical writers??&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In this talk Paul walks us through a selection of his favourite laws of
      software engineering and explores how developers measure them and if
      technical writers must also obey them. Or not. And what that means for the
      success of documentation in a Free Software project.&lt;/p&gt;

    <h4>MacGyvering your docs</h4>

    <p>"So, your project needs better docs. For that, you'd need lots of
      people. Professionalism. A well-thought out plan. All the tools. And a
      whopping budget in both time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Instead, you&#39;re sitting there, with just a few paperclips, seven moldy
      Mentos mints, a strip of Duct tape, a pencil and some nail polish
      remover...&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Oh, hang on! There&#39;s also the combined experiences of generations of
      people fighting seemingly insurmountable odds. From environmental activists
      to LGBTQ people taking to the streets, we can draw on a rich history of
      inspired individuals taking whatever is at hand, mixed with some clever
      zaniness to quite fabulous effect.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;So, what if we apply an activist mindset and some DIY hacking into our
      process? What lessons can we learn from a world where TOC means Theory Of
      Change, where working on a shoestring budget is the norm and where
      empowering people to go beyond what they think they can do is considered
      mission-critical?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;To be clear: the aim here is not to knock professionalism in docs, quite
      the contrary! Yet, faced with a lack of resources, &#39;bend the rules and get
      going&#39; sure beats lethargy. Not to mention being fun...&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;(And before you think I&#39;ll be bringing back the dreaded mullet: the next
      MacGyver will be a woman, according to &lt;a

    <h4>Inclusive Tech Docs - TechComm Meets Accessibility</h4>

    <p>Presenting a business case for quality documentation can sometimes be a
      difficult enough task. Adding to that the accessibility requirements, and
      the whole idea may resemble a mission impossible. The fact that official
      standards (WCAG and WAI-ARIA) themselves seem to require user manuals in
      order to be properly implemented, is not helping developers, technical
      communicators and content managers achieve the desired results. This talk
      will present the main points and a selection of tools to get through the
      labyrinth of WCAG techniques and guidelines, and help you make your techcomm
      project accessibility-ready. Welcome to A11y for Tech Docs!&lt;/p&gt;

    <h4>IMPOSTER NO MORE: How Tech Writers Can Shed Self-Doubt, Embrace Uncertainty, and Surf the Upcoming Swerve in Technical Documentation</h4>

    <p>Do you feel like a fraud? Do you have that sneaking fear of being “found
      out” and exposed? Imposter syndrome is corrosive. It holds us back at work -
      especially in an industry where we can feel constantly under review by
      talented peers - and erodes our happiness. And the subject always comes up
      whenever technical writers gather; sometimes it feels like the very
      definition of a technical writer is “One who experiences imposter
      syndrome.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Why is this? The first, shorter part of this talk will cover some
      research and insights into why we, as documentarians, may be especially
      susceptible to imposter syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;But the field of tech writing is experiencing a swerve: a tipping point -
      a sea change in direction.  There will always be a demand for &#34;&#34;old&#34;&#34; tech
      writing, but many of us will have to adapt to this new environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In the second, forward-looking part of this talk, I’ll argue that being
      an “imposter” has its advantages during such a time of change. The very
      factors that contribute to our self-doubt are actually the qualities that
      will enable us to thrive as our role inexorably evolves to take on new,
      unsolved challenges in engineering information. The keys to our success:
      apophenia (the ability to see connections between seemingly random
      collections of information), empathy, and adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Our future is bright if we pay attention to our new opportunities instead
      of that nagging voice in our heads.&lt;/p&gt;

    <h4>Visual Documentation Language</h4>

    <p>A picture says more than …how many lines of code?</p>

      &lt;p&gt;Firstly this talk offers an introduction to a variety of established as
      well as experimental visual documentation methods. Subsequently, it explores
      the question whether or not these approaches can be applied to software
      documentation in a reasonable way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In this regard it takes a closer look at individual methods and estimates
      their corresponding affordances in terms of time, skill, resources and
      potential automatization.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Eventually, this talk presents an initial attempt to translate existing
      docs into visual languages and discusses the according outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Primarily, the objective of reading and writing the docs serves the
      purpose to convey clear, unambiguous information, at the same time, the
      experience should be as engaging and pleasant as possible. Building a Visual
      Documentation Language serves to reach this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <h4>Writing for what matters. Writing for thinking.</h4>

    <p>Most of the documentation we read today puts a lot of burden on us before
      we have the chance to get to the gist. Abstract and clear concepts are
      replaced by concrete and comprehensive ones. The real values are hindered by
      opaque clouds of facts about tools of trade. As a result, thinking and
      imagination are suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;But what if we can write documentation that encourages thinking?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s look together on what really matters when documenting computer
      systems. We will discuss how a documentation and system design can walk hand
      in hand and to improve the communication between both humans and
      machines.&lt;/p&gt;
