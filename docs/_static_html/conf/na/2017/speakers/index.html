            <h3>Workshop: Learn how to Git</h3>
            
            
            <p>Git is becoming the defacto place to store source code. If you want
to integrate and stay up to date with code, you should also be keeping your documentation
there. This tutorial will take you from feeling uneasy about interacting with
git to making it feel like something you can 'git' the hang of.</p>

<p><em>Learn how to Git</em> with Matt Desmond, who is a technical writer-turned-trainer for
GitHub. Take part in hands-on keyboard exercises that will removes the guesswork
out of managing your development process using Git.</p>

<p>After attending this
session, students will:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Conquer the different Git commands</p></li>
<li><p>Actually understand what that StackOverflow answer means</p></li>
<li><p>Be able to have a conversation about branching strategies (and understand what a
branch even is)</p></li>
<li><p>Become a collaboration machine!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Tickets to this workshop are sold separately. You can

            <h3>Workshop: Structuring and writing documentation</h3>
            
            
            <p>What is a documentation structure, and why does it matter to developers?</p>
<p>Lots of developers get asked to write their own documentation, especially
internal documentation and onboarding. In theory, this is good because they
know the problems they are writing about and don't need to spend time explaining
them. In practice, developers avoid this work because they don't have a good
idea of how to start and can't evaluate whether they have succeeded.</p> <p>This
workshop is designed to teach you a few basic theories of technical documentation,
such as task-based topics, reusable content, and writing for an audience. After
the overview, you'll learn techniques for writing bug reports, error messages,
and onboarding instructions in a tool-agnostic, repeatable way. You'll leave
this workshop with a handful of techniques, templates, and tests that will improve
your team's communication and your life as a developer.</p> <ul> <li><p>What
is structure?</p></li> <li><p>What do I really need to know?</p></li> <li><p>How
to write an error message</p></li> <li><p>How to write a bug report</p></li>
<li><p>What is transparent to writers?</p></li> <li><p>How do you interact with
the team around building stuff.</p></li> </ul> <p>The structure will be 60-90
minutes for basics, and then the rest for workshops.</p><p>Tickets to this workshop
are sold separately. You can <a href='https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-na-2017/with/uhk2elxibho'>buy
your ticket here</a>.</p>

            <p><em>&gt; N</em></p><p>You have found a secret room in the castle!
You gain 26 xp.</p>

<p>You enter a large interior space with stone walls and
a high stone ceiling. Torches flicker in wall brackets. A large self-referential
tapestry hanging on the north wall shows a guild workshop full of happy weavers
busily weaving the very tapestry in which they are depicted. There are exits
to the east, west, and south.</p>

<p><strong>Linden</strong>, another player,
is here. <strong>Gwyrian</strong>, another player, is here.</p>

<p><em>&gt; say "Hi"</em></p>

<p>You say "Hi"</p>

<p>Gwyrian says "Hey! Do you want to explore this area together?"</p>

<p>Linden attacks you with a critical hit from their sword!</p>

<p>You are dead!</p>

<p>Other people: sometimes difficult
to work with and often impossible to predict. In your technical or documentation
project, how can you get the right people interested and involved? How can you
keep those people happily engaged until the work is done? Is there anything
you can do to prevent griefingâ¦ err, âinterpersonal difficultiesâ
from causing delays? And why do some people seem to thrive in an environment
with poor documentation and how can you encourage them to participate in effectively
documenting everything anyway?</p>

<p>In this talk, I'll explore ways to
accomplish these aims, using strategies drawn from âPlayer Type Theoryâ
. For 20 years, this theory has been employed by game designers to encourage stable
long-term play communities in online multiplayer games. These are strategies
that I have used successfully in my workplace and they can work for you too.</p>

            <h3>Testing: it's not just for code anymore</h3>
            
            
            <p>We call ourselves technical writers, but many of us spend more time
editing the work of others than writing ourselves. When you have a large team
or a large product (or both!), the cooks in the documentation kitchen come from
all parts of the company: marketing, product, engineering, sales, and more. This
adds a significant burden on you and your team to make sure the content they produce
is accurate, fits within your style guide, uses the correct tone, and doesn''t
add additional confusion.</p><p>At Mapbox, we have both a large team and a complex
product, which means many different writers with individual writing styles and
varying depth of knowledge of the product. To keep our work accurate and unified
under a common voice while avoiding breaking our necks with editing, we implemented
an automated content testing system (fully open source!) to do some of the work
for us. Automated tests have helped us embed quality writing and editing into
the development process as much as code testing does. &quot;It''s not finished
until it''s documented&quot; is more than just a happy thought -- it''s now an
immovable part of our workflow.</p><p>In this talk, I will discuss the reasons
you might want to implement an automated testing system in your organization,
examples of how it''s been beneficial, the story of how we set up our system,
and a brief overview of the tools that exist for doing this work. I''ll also cover
the ways that automated tests can sometimes make funny mistakes and how we found
the balance between making tests too precise and not precise enough. For those
who are interested in implementing right away, I will also provide a comprehensive
list of resources for getting started.</p>

            <p>Although users typically arrive at doc websites in a confused and
impatient state, not sure of where to find what they're looking for, good navigation
can guide them to the right answer. Good navigation anticipates users' needs,
provides links in commonly viewed places, and brings the right topic into the
foreground amid hundreds of other topics.</p><p>As you build out the navigation
for your doc site, follow these 5 design principles:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Entry
point</strong>. Design the entry point to your system to orient users and allow
them to easily get started.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Hierarchy</strong>. Create
a hierarchical outline of the content to help users both understand and visualize
the body of information.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Modularity</strong>. Break
up content into independent topics that can be viewed, understood, and updated
independent of the whole.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Progressive disclosure</strong>.
Layer the information so that you don't present everything at once but rather
make some content available only at secondary or tertiary levels.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Wayfinding</strong>.
Provide navigational signposts \u2014 such as breadcrumbs and workflow maps
\u2014 to help orient users as to where they are in a larger system.</p></li>

            <p>Getting feedback on your work is a necessary part of any project,
and it makes your output stronger and more diverse. But it can be hard when
your work is being evaluated. Sometimes, it feels like your reviewers have a
deep and abiding interest in pain. You'll never succeed! You may as well
die here! Well, you have already succeeded just by asking for feedback. Together,
we'll discuss how to build up your tolerance for taking that feedback.</p><p>Feedback
became so much easier for me when I learned design critique guidelines from
a co-worker and UX Designer. Design critique guidelines are a set of rules and
practices that can make getting and giving feedback easier. This presentation
passes along the strategies I learned so you can implement design critique guidelines
into your review process and make feedback painless.</p>

            <h3>Only Interesting Conversations: The symbiotic relationship between docs and support</h3>
            
            
            <p><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JpyWi6uN-3zhM77ApzVz15jUw_8dckEh1Hs6dhsac2o/edit?usp=sharing">View the slides</a></strong>.</p>
            
            <p>In this talk I'll discuss the partnership between documentarians and
support and how that relationship can embolden your customers.</p><p>Documentation
can make or break a support interaction. Your average customer or client isn't
interested in a lot of work to use your product. They need to know how to make
your product do &quot;the thing&quot; without, say, opening a Rails console, or
doing some other godforsaken programming trick that you know.</p><p>You might
not know this but your support team has a life of its own that you haven't seen.
Having been a documentarian in the context of a support team, I have some pretty
interesting things to talk about how you can weave relationships to make everyone's
life better, all the way up the food chain.</p><p>I'll talk about how working
in partnership with your support team can not only focus your docs to the points
that matter, but let you see how operating as connective tissue between departments
makes everyone's life easier.</p>

            <h3>Error Messages: Being Humble, Human, and Helpful will make users Happy</h3>

            <p>Writers often forget that users are more likely to see error messages,
tooltips, and helper text than to search for documentation. But these bits of
microcopy are actually an opportunity to communicate and connect with users when
they most need it. Most errors say that something went wrong, but the user doesn''t
know if it''s their fault or what to do about it. As writers, designers, and developers,
we need to help them fix the problem and teach them what to do next time.</p>

<p>Microcopy is also a chance to create a friendly relationship and establish
your brand with your audience. Users are less likely to get frustrated if the
error message has a personal and human sentiment than if it merely says "ACCESS
DENIED", or "FORBIDDEN ACTION". </p>

<p>In this talk I show how making error message Humble, Human, and Helpful is
critical to making your users Happy. We''ll laugh at a few bad errors, and learn
from the good error messages and microcopy. </p>

            <p>My name is Sam and I am the head of technical documentation department
at Zodiac Interactive.</p><p>At Zodiac we create low-level software (we call
it 'middleware') that runs inside cable TV set-top boxes. Most cable companies
in North America use our products; most probably, your set-top box runs at least
some code written by Zodiac.</p><p>Zodiac has R&amp;D departments all over
the world; my office is located in Novosibirsk, Russia â right in the center
of Siberia (so yes, there is a big probability that your set-top box runs some
code that was written in the midst of Siberian taiga)</p><p>Documentation
department at our R&amp;D center concentrates only on architectural documentation:
our docs explain the design and architectural decisions of our software components
to other teams and R&amp;D centers all over the world . We don't document user
interface, write client knowledge bases, or do UI copy. Our technical writers
must be tech-savvy enough to understand the architectural peculiarities of complex
multithreaded applications, must be able to read code in C++ and, above all,
must have perfect written English â Zodiac is an American company, and
we write all our docs in English, not Russian.</p><p>During the last 5 years
our R&amp;D center went from not having any documentarians at all to a team
of 4 excellent and capable technical writers. We were able to set up effective
processes of integrating documentation in overall development activities and
find out good metrics for quality of architectural docs.</p><p>Documentation
processes and documentation quality are frequent topics at Write the Docs, so
I want to talk about more generic things: interviewing, assessing and hiring
technical writers.</p><p>My talk will tackle the following questions:</p>
<ul><li><p>How hard is it to find a "highly technical" technical writer? (remember
that our documentarians must read and understand C++ code)</p></li><li><p>Is
it possible to switch your non-documentarian team members to writing documentation
full-time? Do developers make good technical writers? What about QA engineers?
(our answer was no: it's better to hire new documentarians than to evolve existing
team members into technical writers)</p></li><li><p>Which one is easier: hiring
a technically capable person and teaching them to write well, or hiring a person
with good writing skills but no technical knowledge whatsoever and then training
them on technical stuff? (we went with the second option)</p></li><li><p>Assessing
the candidates: what is the perfect pre-interview assignment test and is it
OK if the typical candidate spends 10-14 days to complete it? Should your candidates
write something that resembles your working docs, or some generic texts on complex
topics are enough? (for example, we ask our candidates to explain SSL certificates
to their math-savvy, but not-cryptographically-inclined uncle: private/public
keys, digital signatures, chains of trust and so on)</p></li><li><p>Interviewing
candidates for a technical writer position: are interviews necessary at all?
Can a good interview outweigh a bad assignment test? Can a bad interview spoil
the impression after a good assignment test? What things should be asked during
an interview?</p></li></ul>

            <p>Are you interested in developing docs like code? Are you frustrated
by the lack of available information as to what that really means and how exactly
you're supposed to do it? Welcome to the club!</p><p>&quot;Treating documentation
like code&quot; is somewhat of a buzzword bingo term these days. You can find
any number of blog posts, presentations, and articles online expounding on the
theory and merits of the idea. When I was presented with an opportunity to truly
integrate documentation into the agile development process almost 2 years ago,
I couldn't find any information that could teach me how to treat docs like
code. Since then, I've worked with a team of passionate software engineers to
bring a long list of 'awesome-future' ideas for treating documentation like
code into practice. In this presentation, I'll lay out how we create, test,
build, and publish our documentation using agile methodologies, so others starting
down the same road have a path to follow.</p><p>In the beginning, we had a great
idea - documentation should be developed, tested, and built just like the products
we make. The keystone of this grand vision was the idea that docs live in the
same repositories as the code, use the same development tools and code review
processes, and follow a continuous delivery model. I'll go over the tools we
chose to write, build, and test the docs; the responsibilities of the software
engineers and technical writer, respectively, for creating and maintaining content;
the docs information architecture we developed; how we incorporated syntax and
grammar checks into code testing; and how we build and deploy our documentation
automatically.</p>

            <h3>No Community Members Were Harmed in the Making of This Doc Sprint: How we ran a 48-hour event to collect community wisdom into a guidebook for newsroom developers</h3>
            
            
            <p>For developers in newsrooms, whose work supports great writing and
journalism all day long, writing their own docs often falls by the wayside. News
deadlines can leave little time for cleanup and documentation (much less the planning
that leads to reusable code). At OpenNews, these developers, designers, and data
analysts are our community, and we designed a series of small events to address
that time crunch. We bring people together a few times a year to refine, document,
and release open-source projects, because a common set of tools means more time
spent covering the news, less time on recreating code.</p><p>During these events,
we''ve seen a common set of cultural and technical questions come up before, during,
and after projects--but our community didn''t have a common pool of answers.</p><p>So
last year, we did something about it. Inspired by collaborative book-writing projects,
we put together a community documentation sprint in December 2016. The goal: to
draft a guidebook for releasing newsroom code. Over two intensive days, 11 contributors
gathered with us in Washington, D.C., and another dozen signed on as remote editors.
Together, they captured our community''s best practices for open-sourcing software,
specifically in the context of newsrooms and journalism. They worked in pairs
or small groups, clustered around laptops, collaborating for long stretches of
writing. We fed them many snacks.</p><p>The Field Guide to Open Source in the
Newsroom launched in February, and we learned a lot as it came together. We''d
love to tell you:</p><ul><li><p>How we recruited and prepared a diverse, expert
team of participants for a productive event</p></li><li><p>How we ran the two-day
documentation sprint, with a flexible, supportive structure</p></li><li><p>How
we built in time for followthrough after the event, with plans for outreach, adoption
and onboarding</p></li><li><p>And how we made the whole thing human-friendly</p></li></ul></p>

            <p>The Wisdom of Crowds:Crowdsourcing Minimalism in an Open Organization
by Ingrid Towey, Brice Fallon-Freeman, and Aneta PetrovÃ¡</p><p>What does
choosing flavors of LaCroix sparkling water for the Red Hat breakroom have to
do with improving technical documentation? At Red Hat, everything. </p><p>You
see, when we wanted to make a culture shift in our approach to documentation,
we couldn't legislate the change from the top down. Managers and experts
just don't have that kind of authority at Red Hat. Changing the way we
write has had to be a grassroots, bottom-up effort. Just like we all get to
vote on which flavors of sparkling water and other beverages are stocked in
our fridge, writers, editors, content strategists, and managers ALL have a say
in our latest writing trends. At Red Hat, we have an open culture where people
expect to have a voice in decisions and aren't afraid to speak their minds.
This open culture affects every aspect of our working lives.</p><p>What Did
We Want to Change? We wanted to introduce our teams to minimalist writing.
But first we had to convince people that minimalism isn't just about shorter
sentences and less fluffy documentation. Minimalist writing means that you focus
like a laser on just what your customers need at the moment. It's harder
than it sounds. </p><p>How Did We Do It?First, we formed an international
team that could influence writers across all our geographical regions (geos).
Brice Fallon-Freeman (from Australia), Aneta PetrovÃ¡ (from the Czech Republic),
and I (from the US) became this team and brainstormed ways to introduce these
concepts to our departments. </p><p>Aneta and Brice came up with the idea
of crowdsourcing minimalist writing critiques, and all three of us tried the
concept in our different geos. We got volunteers to join our groups, and then
we got more volunteers who were willing to have their content critiqued. This
âcrowdâ of writers and editors then worked together to give meaningful
feedback to the people who had been brave enough to volunteer their content.
</p><p>The beauty of this model is that it gives experienced writers a way
to teach more junior writers without the process being apparent. No one has
to admit to being ignorant. Inexperienced writers get to learn about minimalism
by watching other people apply it to real content and not in some kind of fake
training situation. </p><p>This talk will discuss our strategies and methods
in more detail and show examples of content before and after crowdsourced minimalism.</p>

            <h3>Caring Systems: Documentation as care</h3>
            
            
            <p>All humans require care. Writing and maintaining documentation is
a form of care: good documentation can make us feel cared-for, and we, as writers,
can take satisfaction from empathizing with the end users of our work, and performing
the caring work of documentation. By exploring and acknowledging the relationship
between care, documentation, and technology, I argue, we can better understand
and advocate for the value of our work. More so, understanding the importance
of care allows us to work better.</p><p>This talk illustrates how the work of
documentation is care work, and explores the ethical, philosophical and economic
dimensions of care in relationship to technical writing and documentation. I'll
share findings and case studies from my own consulting practice, and explore
patterns (and anti-patterns) I've observed around documentation and care.
Then, to spur small group discussions, I'll share design principles for
documentation as care.</p>

            <p>How do you âbootstrap docsâ? In this talk, I will walk through
how to build essential docs for an early stage startup that lays a strong foundation
for continuous improvement and expansion. The story will be told through my
experiences building docs from scratch for CockroachDB (https://www.cockroachlabs.com),
a next-generation open source database.</p><p>When I joined Cockroach Labs
as its first technical writer, CockroachDB had been in development for nearly
two years and had 15 engineers and 60+ open source developers contributing to
it. I needed to build a documentation structure and process that would be lightweight
enough for developers to contribute to and flexible enough to apply to the product
(and team) years down the road. </p><p>This talk will walk the audience through
the process of learning a new product and development team, and allowing that
information to guide the information architecture and tool selection process.
</p><p>Topics will include: - How do you learn a new product, and why is
it essential to understand its market fit? - How do you learn about your users
- who are they, what are their primary pain points, and what do they need most
from docs? - How do you choose tools and workflows for building your initial
docs architecture? - How do you iterate on, improve, and expand your docs,
and harness contributors to do the same? </p>

            <p>Writers of software and writers of documentation practice a shared
art: we bestow abstractions with names. We know we''ve succeeded when our names
illuminate concepts, elicit a-ha moments, and empower users to put our product
to work. We know we''ve failed when the names we''ve chosen confuse, frustrate,
misguide, or offend.</p>

<p>Naming things well matters. Too often, though, good names are hard to come
by, and bad names are hard to change.</p>

<p>Using a lengthy and ever-growing list of Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very
Bad names encountered during my career as an engineer, this talk will address:

- Why is it so hard to name things well in software?

- Why do bad names persist?

- What are some heuristics for assessing how good or bad a name is?

- How has technology hampered efforts to name things well?

- How can technology help our efforts to name things well?

- How can documentarians and developers work together to name things better?</p>

            <h3>Start with the tasks, not the endpoints</h3>

            <p>Last spring, as I approached reworking the information architecture
of the NPR One Developer Center, I started by interviewing several of our partner
developers to find out what pain points they encountered when developing on
our platform.</p><p>Overwhelmingly, the responses included complaints about
confusing site navigation and frustration around having to search multiple pages
to string together the necessary information to implement features. After considering
this feedback, we redesigned the documentation site to focus on information
needed to complete a desired task, and while we still provide endpoint reference
documentation, my focus now is to start from thinking about what a developer
is trying to accomplish, rather than what data an endpoint is capable of providing.
Essentially, the focus of the docs shifted away from what the API can do, towards
what âIâ, as the developer, can do with this API.</p><p>Taking a task-oriented
approach allowed us to reorganize and revise our content in a way that has significantly
shortened our onboarding process for partner developers, shortening the app
verification process and time-to-market, and most importantly allows us to better
collaborate with our partners to develop exciting new experiences for NPR listeners.
For those who work on documenting hypermedia APIs, this can be a particularly
useful approach, since these services tend to have fewer specific endpoints,
and the documentation needs to focus much more on how the client can successfully
navigate links to accomplish the desired task. In this 30-minute talk, I'
ll discuss how you can successfully integrate this approach to your workflow
when considering everything from overall information architecture, to deciding
which content assets to prioritize, to refining the tone used throughout your
developer communications.</p>

            <p>This talk is about the verifiability crisis in science, politics,
and technology, and how methods developed to address verifiablity in statistical
publishing can be adapted to other areas such as technical writing.</p><ul>
<li><p>In 2015, a group of researchers set out to replicate the results  obtained
in a set of 100 published psychology research papers. It  turned out that
only 29 out of the 100 could be replicated. </p></li><li><p>In the 2016 elections,
so-called "fake news"--fabricated news  published on venues such as Facebook--influenced
many voters in their  choice of candidates.</p></li><li><p>In the field
of technical writing, it is not uncommon to discover that  technical documentation
is inaccurate. Although the docs might have  been accurate when first published,
the underlying technology evolved  rendering the docs obsolete. </p></li>
</ul><p>Academic, public-policy, and business decisions are sometimes made after
accepting published (mis)information at face value. The costs can beconsiderable.</p>
<p>The information often arrives in the form of an electronic document, such as
a web page or PDF file. To verify the information, someone has to "fact check"
it.  But what if the document could, in some sense, "speakfor itself" and
demonstrate the veracity of what it is saying?</p><p>In response to the verifiability
crisis in science, statisticians havedeveloped technology to create "intelligent
documents" that not onlyreport the results of a statistical analysis, but
can also re-create theanalysis itself.</p>

            <p>Come along on a tour of common types of documentation system administrators
use to get their jobs done.</p><p>As an enterprise software developer, system
administrators are my customers and colleagues. In this session, learn not just
what gets used, but also what internal and informal sources to look for to create
better docs. I'll share what I've learned sysadmins want from the written information
they rely on daily. I'll also talk about what ops teams write for themselves
that can add important details to your documents.</p><p>We'll go beyond
glossy presentation slides of instructor-led training to delve into what's
meaningful for day-to-day tasks. For example, integration and migration: to
accomplish this smoothly, sysadmins need references and examples to install,
configure, and customize new tools to work with existing systems. Tutorials
can show how, real-world configuration examples show what, and cookbooks provide
ready-made examples to customize as needed. Deployment checklists ensure the
rollout goes smoothly.</p><p>Emergencies can happen at any hour\u2014which
is why runbooks can be so valuable. With step-by-step details so staff can respond
without making mistakes. A junior engineer can resolve an issue without calling
a developer for help. Manifests, dependency lists, and logs become necessary
adjuncts to documentation, providing critical data for root cause analysis.</p><p>Learn
about these sources, not just how others use them, but where you can find valuable
detail to enhance the documents you write for operations.</p>
