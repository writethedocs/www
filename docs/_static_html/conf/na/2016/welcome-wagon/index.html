<a class="reference external" href="mailto:canncrochet&#37;&#52;&#48;gmail&#46;com">Christy</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:leona&#46;campbell&#37;&#52;&#48;jivesoftware&#46;com">Leona</a> if we can help make

<h2>Pro Tips<a class="headerlink" href="#pro-tips" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You don’t need to go to every talk. Look through the schedule of
events before you arrive or while you are eating or taking a break.
Figure out which talks you want to see the most. Spread out your time
between talks, unconference sessions, networking, and breaks.</li>
<li>Speaking of breaks–conferences are exhilarating, but can also be
exhausting. Give your brain a break! Grab a quiet spot in Lola’s Room
or take a quick walk. Play a board game on your lunch break. Come
back invigorated.</li>
<li>Starting Monday morning, check the unconference schedule in Lola’s
Room to see if there are any sessions you are interested in
attending. New sessions are added all the time, so check back
periodically.</li>
<li>Eat! You can use the energy.</li>
<li>Are you looking for a job or is there an opening at your company?
Check out the job board in Lola’s Room.</li>

<p>The conference main stage is in the Crystal Ballroom on the third floor

<p>Most of the other events take place within a few blocks of the Crystal

<ul class="simple">
<li>Writing Day documentation sprints happen at the CENTRL office at 1335
NW Everett Street, which is 4 blocks from the conference venue.</li>
<li>Write the Docs party is at the Jack Knife, 614 SW 11th Ave.</li>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Portland is a casual-dress town and so is the Write the Docs
conference. You’ll be meeting business colleagues at this conference,
though, so neat and comfortable are good dress guidelines.</li>
<li>If you are going on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/hike/">Write the Docs hike on
Saturday</a>, be sure
to bring appropriate hiking clothes and shoes. This time of year, the

where to get your morning coffee.</li>
<li>Coffee, tea, and water are always available in the Crystal Ballroom.

<li>On Saturday, Sunday, and in the evening on Monday and Tuesday,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/visiting/">explore Portland’s amazing food
scene</a>. Invite
someone you just met to join you! If you are invited to dinner, say
yes! Making connections over dinner is a great way to get to know
more people.</li>

<li>Lightning talks are a great way to practice public speaking, get

or review a process? Then, yes! Sign up for a lightning talk. There

<p>Attend the Welcome Wagon events. Make connections with other first-time
attendees and get advice from seasoned pros.</p>
<p>The most important part of this conference (and any conference) is the
people you meet. Set a goal for yourself to meet a few, new people. Here
are some tips:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Find out who is attending the conference before you get there. Join
the <a class="reference external" href="https://writethedocs.slack.com/">Write the Docs Slack</a>, follow
the <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/writethedocs">Write the Docs on Twitter</a>,
and review the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/speakers/">list of
speakers</a>.</li>
<li>Figure out which companies will be represented at the conference. If
you see a job post you’re interested in, you might want to ask them a
few questions. This might be a great time to better understand what
it’s like to work at certain companies.</li>
<li>Make a list of a few people you would like to meet, and write down
some questions for them. If you can find contact information, email
them before the conference and let them know you are looking forward
to chatting.</li>
<li>Most importantly, remember that you don’t have to meet everyone. In
fact, you shouldn’t. You should plan to make a few, meaningful
connections. That is what the Write the Docs conference is about, so
go for it! Introduce yourself.</li>
</ul>
