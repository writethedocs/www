Search engine optimization (SEO) for documentation
==================================================

What is search engine optimization?
-----------------------------------

Search engines drive a significant portion of site traffic for docs that publish as public-facing websites.
Search engine optimization (SEO) describes the methods used to improve the rank of your web pages in search results for a given set of search terms.

To perform SEO, you must be familiar with the ever-changing algorithms that search engines use to select and arrange the webpages returned for a given set of search terms.
These algorithms change frequently, so the requirements for achieving the best optimization also change frequently.

SEO for documentation
---------------------

Good tech writing follows most of the standard practices required for excellent SEO:

- Write imperative, user-centric, goal-oriented headings
- Make your docs skimmable by breaking content into sections under appropriate headings
- Focus on good information architecture that provides quality navigation and site hierarchy
- Include page metadata, such as last modified date, in the ``<head>`` section of your web page (how to do this varies by your publication toolchain)
- Make sure your documentation meets :doc:`standards for accessibility </guide/writing/accessibility>`
