Getting started: documentation best practices for developers
=======================================================================

Are you a developer who wants to write the docs for your project?
You've come to the *write* place.

Use this guide to find relevant documentation best practices depending on your situation. 

Writing documentation as an open-source developer
-------------------------------------------------

You have awesome open-source code, but do people know how to use it?
Good documentation improves the chance of someone discovering and using your code.

If you are an open-source developer, see :doc:`writing/beginners-guide-to-docs`,
for practical advice on getting started.

Justifying documentation as a developer at a company
----------------------------------------------------

How do you justify writing documentation for your project?
Your deadlines hardly allow time to write tests,
and docs are always delayed until the end.

To show the value of documentation to your boss and get a blueprint for 
implementing a documentation solution at your company, see :doc:`writing/mindshare`.

The value of technical writing and documentation
----------------------------------------------------

"traditional" technical writing has evolved to encompass a broad mix of skills and specialties that either didn't exist before or where siloed into "single-hat" job titles.

On this modern school of thought, documentation (and/or technical writing) efforts now routinely incorporate a multi-disciplinary approach:

- Quality Control, regression testing, REST API testing
- Customer Support, Customer Success, project/repository maintainence
- Developer Relations, SDK software development
- Documentation tooling, parers, build tools, frameworks
- The engineering to support those systems at scale (since popular documention can have as many views as many entire SaaS applications)
- Certifications, manuals, specifications, curricula
- Search Engine Optimization, localization, translation, accessibility
- And, many of the above can be standalone products in their own right (not just part of another product's ensemble).

Indeed, many such "writers" are software developers or activately engaged in software development today. 

To write excellent, accurate, documentation is to rigorously test and verify products:

- In doing so, documentation can be seen as a part of Quality Control (and indeed is increasingly found under or embedded within Engineering, Customer Success, and Quality Control orgs).
- How does one know what the REST API Status Codes or Responses are for a successful API Request? 
- And, for the unsuccessful ones?

How does one demonstrate the value of technical writing:

- Define and establish important metrics
- Research, suggest, define, and/or implement tools to track/record those metrics: Customer Satisfaction, Customer churn (did one dampen the number of customers that were lost, complaining, or unhappy), and so on.
- From a Project Management perspective: how much is saved by having a dedicated Technical Writer or Documentation Engineer? 
- Suppose a team of five Platform Software Engineers spend 15% of their capacity on customer-facing documentation (instead of product engineering), is it better to have a dedicated Technical Writer so the Platform Engineers can retask?
- How much is gained by keeping customers happy, keeping customers, or acquiring new ones (growth, revenue-wise)? Poor documentation is wide-spread complaint and cause of customer malaise.
- From a Product Ownership standpoint: how much does documentation contribute to the Product Vision?
- Documentation is increasingly necessary for many SaaS offerings, cloud, and software products to succeed. Without it, a product may fail to gain traction, interest, or use.

When in doubt, remember that technical writing and documentation are more than a static summary of concepts and terms - they're activities that're continuous with overall efforts to improve engineering 
and customer satisfaction! Despite that, documentation is often conflated with other kinds of similar writing or content: marketing and blogging, for example.

In what ways do these differ?

- Documentation is often a valuable resource for engineering leadership to test, try, and determine whether a product fits within their orgs needs. 
- As such, one excellent document can win over a major customer in ways marketing or advertisements will or (legally) cannot (e.g. - compliance).
- Documentation is often a last resort in difficult technical situations - a "hail mary" that can *save* an org or team!
- In this way, technical documentation can differ significantly from marketing, blog posts, and other kinds of similar content.
- Documentation provides a record for important business and engineering decisions: architecture, design documentation, acceptance criteria, test validation, etc. Such documentation artifacts are first-class resources in day-to-day engineering.

Documentation in the age of Large Language Models
----------------------------------------------------

What about Large Language Models, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning? Does that spell the end of technical writing and/or human-centric documentation?

- For the foreseeable future technical writing will probably be *a* (or *the*) primary source of content and truth for Large Language Models. 
- From what data will ***future***, not yet existing, Frameworks, Tools, Languages, and Versions be sourced? (Statistical methods require vast amounts of data for accuracy after all.)
- How will we validate Machine Learning models and outputs for accuracy and competency? Presumably a human expert. 
- (And, any near-future Machine Learning models that might replace human experts will nevertheless require such human experts in the meantime.)

Perhaps in time some of these activities will be increasingly delegated to automated tooling and systems. And this should not be such a big surprise nor a great cause for despair (think of all that's already presently automated and that can still be simplified/made easier)! Documention will continue to evolve.
