Starting off: documentation best practices for developers
=======================================================================

Are you a developer who wants to write the docs for your project?
You've come to the *write* place.

Use this guide to find relevant documentation best practices depending on your situation. 

Writing documentation as an open-source developer
-------------------------------------------------

You have awesome open-source code, but do people know how to use it?
Good documentation improves the chance of someone discovering and using your code.

If you are an open-source developer, see :doc:`writing/beginners-guide-to-docs`,
for practical advice on getting started.

Justifying documentation as a developer at a company
----------------------------------------------------

How do you justify writing documentation for your project?
Your deadlines hardly allow time to write tests,
and docs are always delayed until the end.

To show the value of documentation to your boss and get a blueprint for 
implementing a documentation solution at your company, see :doc:`writing/mindshare`.
