Starting off: documentation best practices for developers
=======================================================================

Want to write the docs for your project?
You've come to the write [sic] place.

Developers need to write documentation for many situations.
This guide leads you to relevant writing tactics for several situations. 

Open source developers
----------------------

You have awesome open-source code, but do people know how to use it?
Good documentation improves the chance of someone discovering and using your code.

If you are an open-source developer, start with :doc:`writing/beginners-guide-to-docs`,
for practical advice on getting started.

Developers at a company
-----------------------

How do you justify writing documentation for your project?
Your deadlines hardly allow time to write tests,
and docs are always delayed until the end.

To show the value of documentation to your boss, see :doc:`writing/mindshare`
for a blueprint on implementing a documentation solution at your company.

Enterprise users
----------------

You are a SAAS or Services company and you have developers as your target
audience.
If you don't have great documentation,
your competitors will leave you in the dust.
It will also jack up your support costs,
because customers can't help themselves.

This page of :ref:`interesting-approaches` is a good starting point to see
some documentation that is well done.
