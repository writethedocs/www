## What's a Documentarian?

Write the Docs has added another usage of the word "documentarian".
We are slightly extending the classic definition of:

	A writer, photographer, or other artist whose work constitutes a document or documentary of an aspect of life.

We believe that a Documentarian also works with another definition:

	A person who views products in terms of teachability
