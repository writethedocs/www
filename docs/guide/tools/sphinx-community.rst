Community perspectives on Sphinx
==================================

This page captures common experiences and feedback from the Write the Docs community about using Sphinx, based on discussions at Write the Docs Portland 2021 and ongoing community conversations.

What users appreciate
---------------------

Community members frequently highlight Sphinx's strengths for technical documentation:

- Code introspection and tight integration with source code (docs-as-code approach)
- Powerful reStructuredText markup for complex documentation needs
- Intersphinx for cross-linking between projects
- Strong domain support for multiple programming languages

Common challenges
-----------------

New users often encounter similar hurdles when learning Sphinx:

**Learning curve**: Sphinx presents a significant barrier to entry, particularly for those new to documentation tools or reStructuredText.

**Navigation setup**: Creating and managing toctree structures requires careful planning and can be unintuitive initially.

**Documentation style**: The official Sphinx documentation is comprehensive but geared toward reference rather than learning. New users often benefit from supplementary tutorials like those listed in the :doc:`/guide/tools/sphinx` introduction.

**Theming**: Customizing Sphinx themes requires understanding the templating system, which can be challenging. The :doc:`/guide/tools/sphinx-themes` page provides recommended starting points.

Resources and community
-----------------------

The Sphinx community continues to create learning resources to address the steep learning curve:

- `Sphinx Tutorial <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/>`_ - Official tutorial for newcomers
- `Read the Docs Getting Started <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html>`_ - Step-by-step guide
