# Accessibility guidelines: for writing and beyond

Accessibility is an important aspect of any good web project, and docs are no exception. As one advocate puts it, "... if the content design is simple, concise, and clear you are already doing a lot for both a11y and localization."

And to make this page as accessible as possible: the term `a11y` is what's called a numeronym, or shorthand in this case for "accessibility", where `11` is the number of letters between the `a` and the `y`.
