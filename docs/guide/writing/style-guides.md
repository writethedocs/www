# Style Guides

A style guide is a set of standards for the writing and design of content, defining the style to be used in communication within a particular organization. Basically, style guides are put together to clarify [the way a group of people talk and write about the things they do](http://www.writethedocs.org/style-guide/). Think of authoring best practices.

If you happen to have a background in academia or journalism, you will probably be familiar the [AP stylebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Stylebook) or the [Chicago manual of style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style). Those are great resources for writing in general, particularly for grammar and syntax, but if you're reading this page chances are you are considering style in the context of technical documentation.

### Technical Document
Style guides help you write a variety of content, such as documenting the methods of an API, or presenting a overview of complex technical concepts, or focusing on how to write particular content like user manuals, release notes, or tutorials.

Style guides often focus on the reader, helping you communicate to developers, product managers, the general public, and so forth. Others focus on the language itself (tone, style, grammar). Others provide best practices on how to manage your content, version control, or publication and delivery strategies.

## Why do I need a style guide?
A practical reason to use a style guide is that they help you write content. Human languages are extremely flexible, and there are many ways in which a particular message can be communicated. By following a style guide you limit the variation, making it easier for you to focus on getting your message across. This makes style guides extremely useful for people joining projects.

Style guides also increase consistency in your content. There are good reasons why you want to keep a consistent tone, voice and style in your documentation. Marketing-oriented folks understand the importance of voice and tone in building a brand identity, but consistency also has a big impact on how effectively you communicate -- that is, on how well you manage to transfer a particular information to your audience.

There's an actual science behind this. Our brains appear to be hardwired to identify differences -- anything that stands out from its context will catch our attention. A lot of variation will drain our cognitive resources, making it more difficult for us to assimilate information. The degree to which cognitive resources are drained varies between people, but in general it is a good idea to minimize the [cognitive load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load) of your communications.

## Different styles for different folk

Choosing the right style guide for your project depends on your particular context:
  - Who you are
  - Who you are writing for
  - What you are writing about
    
Good writing takes its audience into consideration and adjusts to the needs and expectations of that audience.
We have selected a number of style guides resources for a variety of context -- hopefully you'll find something that suits you and your project.

### Who are you

If you belong to an open-source community or NGO, you can consider the following resources:
    - [18F Content Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov)
    - [Open SUSE Style Guide](https://doc.opensuse.org/products/opensuse/Styleguide/opensuse_documentation_styleguide_sd/)

If are employed by a for-profit company, there may already be a style guide at use somewhere within your organization.
It is a good idea to ask your colleagues about this before you consider picking a particular style guide for your project.

### Who are you writing to

### What are you writing about

Many companies use style guides of their own choice and writers are obligated to follow those standards. For large companies a style guide ensures consistent documentation across the globe. It helps you to focus on content while providing the means to create a good structure. 

What kind of company / organisation?
- big companies
- startups
- web companies
- You are a part of a community

### Purpose - What do you write? Manuals, APIs

Technical documentation takes many forms, each one targeting a certain need. Here, we can think of examples like tutorials, API documentation, and user manuals. Each of these has specificities that the the others don't share. So while style guides can adequately cover the main concerns of all technical documentation, sometimes a more specialized guide is needed.

## Specific Topics

### Writing Style 
Nobody can tell you how to write. This comes naturally: writers write in a voice and style they have mastered over time. The style guides below offer guidelines and suggestions. They focus on how to make technical content readable, clear, succinct,  and engaging. And some actually take the tedious leap into grammar.
