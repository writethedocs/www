What is UX writing?
===================

UX writing is the practice of creating text that users see in the interface of a software, e.g. buttons, labels, error messages, etc - i.e. all the copy that guides users through the product. This texts is often referred to as “microcopy”. 

As UX writer Lisa Sanchez puts it in her `Medium <https://medium.com/@lmsanchez/what-is-ux-writing-1eb71b0f0606>`_ blog: “It’s about designing the conversation between a product and its user. [...] Many of the things that make UX writing good are the things that make other writing good too: clarity, consistency, precision, self-awareness, a whole lot of revision, and thoughtful attention to the context and the audience.”

In other words: A UX writer’s skill set has a lot in common with the one of a tech writer. And often, they’re different hats worn by the same person. So, if you’re interested in breaking into UX writing yourself, here’s a list of resources (by no means comprehensive) to get you started:
