API documentation tools
=======================

Specialized descriptive languages help when writing API documentation.
Some of our favorite descriptive languages include:

* :ref:`blueprint`
* Swagger

When specifying a descriptive language for your API, you'll also need tools to create engaging
documents. Several tools work best with our favorite descriptive languages:

* :ref:`apiary-overview`
* Aglio
* :doc:`Sphinx </guide/tools/sphinx>`

Apiary
~~~~~~

Apiary is a service that allows you to edit and host documentation online.

Hosting Apiary docs
-------------------

Apiary provides a service for creating and hosting API documentation described in the :ref:`blueprint`
or Swagger format. Once the API description is complete, Apiary generates interactive documentation in a
three column layout. Example requests and responses are shown for every endpoint in multiple
programming languages. It also enables the user to make requests to your live API.

Building Apiary docs
--------------------

To build Apiary docs locally, follow these steps:

1. `Install the Apiary CLI Tools. <https://help.apiary.io/tools/apiary-cli/>`_
2. Navigate to the directory containing your ``.apib`` file.
3. Run the following to validate your ``.apib`` file and create the HTML file::

    apiary preview --path="myfile.apib" --output="myfile.html"

4. View the document in your browser.

.. _blueprint:

API Blueprint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

API Blueprint is a high-level language for describing web APIs. The goal of the API Blueprint format
is to support the design-first philosophy for REST APIs; however, the format also works for
documenting existing APIs. The files are saved with a `.apib` extension.

The syntax combines Markdown syntax and Markdown Syntax for Object Notation (MSON). Markdown is a
lightweight text formatting syntax and `MSON <https://github.com/apiaryio/mson>`_ is an extension
of Markdown for describing data objects.

Getting started with API Blueprint
----------------------------------

The quickest way to get started with API Blueprint is to use `Apiary <https://apiary.io/>`_ to edit and view your
documentation by following these steps:

1. Sign up for an account `on Apiary. <https://login.apiary.io/register>`_
2. Follow the `API Blueprint Tutorial. <https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/tutorial.html>`_ to describe an API.

Writing API Blueprint docs
--------------------------

The structure for an ``.apib`` file is::

  Metadata
  API Name
  Resource Group
    Resource
      Action
      Action
    Resource
  Resource Group
  Data Structures

``Metadata``:
  describes the API Blueprint version

``API Name``:
  your API name

``Resource Groups``:
  describes a collection of related API endpoints

``Resources``:
  describes a specific API endpoint

``Actions``:
  describes specific HTTP verb actions to an endpoint

``Data Structures``:
  describes data used in your API requests/responses. By defining them in a separate section, they
  can easily be reused.

Building API Blueprint docs
---------------------------

The two most popular tools for generating documents from API Blueprints are :ref:`Apiary <apiary-building-docs>` and
`Aglio <https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio>`_.

Testing API docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When specifying an API in a descriptive language, you don't have to manually
validate your documents. Tools like Dredd can test your documentation against the live API.
