  		<p>Write the Docs is a global community of people who care about documentation. There is also a legal entity that exists to build and support the global community of documentarians. The company’s primary role is to manage the community’s legal and business assets.</p>
  		<p>This document describes the guiding principles that drive us as an organization, our governance model, and what all this means for our community members.</p>

					<div class="title">Grow too quickly </div>
					<p>Many organizations prioritize growth over sustainability and run the risk of over-extending their resources. By keeping the number of concurrent experiments small and gradual, we hope to test and optimize each new thing before moving on to the next thing.</p>

				<div class="reason">

					<p>All our teams and roles are opt-in, and we prioritize self care and work-life balance. Our volunteers and paid team members are encouraged to take on tasks that they derive professional and personal value from, and we check-in periodically to make sure that our contributors are happy with their roles within the community.</p>

					<div class="title">Restrict membership</div>
					<p>We are an open community, not a trade union or a guild. We will never require a membership fee to participate in our community, although we might experiment with opt-in community sponsorship in the future in order to sustain and develop our services to the community. We take our Code of Conduct to heart and are the first to implement it in our own operations.</p>

					<div class="title">Get stuck in our ways.</div>
					<p>Everyone is welcome to propose and pilot new experiments, and we constantly seek and implement feedback from the community. We aim to send out feedback surveys after every conference to attendees, speakers, volunteers, and sponsors, so that we can evolve our activities along with the natural evolution of the community.</p>

	<div class="uk-container FAQ">
		<h2>Legal Entity</h2>
		<h3>Write the Docs is an Oregon Limited Liability Company (LLC), which is one of the standard USA corporate classifications. The LLC is wholly owned by Eric Holscher, one of the founders of Write the Docs.</h3>

		<p>This organization controls and handles:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>“Write the Docs” trademark</li>
			<li>writethedocs.org domain</li>
			<li>@writethedocs Twitter account</li>
			<li>Bank accounts that hold money for the conferences</li>
			<li>Contracts for all conferences and operations</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>FAQ</h2>

		<p class="question">Why aren’t you a non-profit?</p>
		<ul class="answers">
			<li>In order to achieve an official non-profit tax status, one must venture on a long and arduous journey with a high legal, bureaucratic, and financial investment. When we researched this we realized that frankly, whatever benefits we might get simply don’t justify the costs.</li>
			<li>The running costs of maintaining a non-profit status would require us to redirect money from the community to various accountants, lawyers, and administrative entities, rather than reinvest said money in operations that directly benefit the community. We do work with a bookkeeper to help us keep our taxes in order, but as an LLC, compliance is more simple and allows us to focus on what we can do directly for the community.</li>
			<li>Non-profits are limited in how they can generate revenue, and as an open organization with community-focused operations, we can’t afford the restriction. If we can’t experiment with sustainable income models, we cannot evolve along with the community.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="question">Why do you have a paid core team?</p>
		<ul class="answers">
			<li>Running conferences on a volunteer basis might be fun at first, but it can become a burden after a few years. And, as the community grows and evolves, so do the roles and responsibilities of the people who are supporting the community.</li>
			<li>Write the Docs bases much of its philosophy on open-source community models, and we have witnessed many cases where long-term contributors to various projects suffered from increasing pressure, burnout, and resentment towards the very same communities that they felt a part of.</li>
			<li>As our core team solidified over the years, we realized that if we want to sustain and scale the community, we must also sustain the people who are supporting the community. Appropriate compensation is the next step in retaining the people who are maintaining the infrastructure, running the conferences, securing sponsorship, and managing the content archives.</li>
