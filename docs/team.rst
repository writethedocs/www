Team
====

The different facets of the Write the Docs community is kept running smoothly by
a wonderful team of folks. We are always looking for more people to help
organize conferences and meetups, help out with websites and guides, or take
leadership roles in the community. This page documents the roles that people are
currently in charge.

If you're interested in helping out, get in touch with someone on the team
you're curious about. Messaging folks on the Write the Docs :doc:`slack`
is probably the best way to get in touch with
folks.

.. note:: The folks with an asterisk (*) next to their names are the team leads.
          They get to choose who is in each team, so they are the best folks to
          talk to about how to join their team.
