Team
====

The different facets of the Write the Docs community are kept running smoothly by a wonderful team of folks. We are always looking for more people to help organize conferences and meetups, help out with websites and guides, or take leadership roles in the community.

If you're interested in helping out, get in touch with someone on the team you're curious about. Messaging folks on the Write the Docs :doc:`slack` is probably the best way to get in touch with folks.

.. note:: The folks with (team lead) next to their names are the best folks to talk to about how to join their team.

How teams operate and interact
------------------------------
