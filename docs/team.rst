Team

Write the Docs is a community effort that is enabled by a wonderful team of folks.
We are always looking for more people to help organize conferences,
meetups,
or take a leadership role in the community.
This page documents the status of different members of the community,
and also explains some of the roles that people are filling.

If you're interested in helping out,
get in touch with someone on the team you're curious about.
Messaging folks on the Write the Docs `Slack <http://slack.writethedocs.com/>`_ is probably the best way to get in touch with folks.

.. note:: The folks with an asterisk (*) next to their names are the team leads.
          They get to choose who is in each team,
          so they are the best folks to talk to about how to join their team.
