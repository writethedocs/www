Team
====

The different facets of the Write the Docs community are kept running smoothly by a wonderful team of folks. We are always looking for more people to help organize conferences and meetups, help out with websites and guides, or take leadership roles in the community.

If you're interested in helping out, get in touch with someone on the team you're curious about. Messaging folks on the Write the Docs :doc:`slack` is probably the best way to get in touch with folks.

.. note:: The folks with (team lead) next to their names are the best folks to talk to about how to join their team.

How teams operate and interact
------------------------------

- **All membership and leadership roles are staffed by enthusiastic opt-in.** We want to prioritize the well-being of our contributors, and we're happy to have you if you're happy to contribute to the community.
- Each team operates independently except for actions that impact other teams or the community.

- CoreOps team members act as backup team leads in a case team lead steps down without a replacement.
- Teams are generally comprised of volunteers. Depending on the scope and time investment of team members, they can step up to be a team lead after an agreed upon duration of service on the team.
