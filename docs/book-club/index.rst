January - February 2020: The Product is Docs
============================================

In January 2020, the Write the Docs community ran an online book club, discussing Splunk's `The Product is Docs <https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/splunklife/the-product-is-docs.html>`_.

Discussions were on the 1st edition. Christopher Gales and the Splunk Team have since released a 2nd edition, incorporating in part some of the discussion from our book club.
