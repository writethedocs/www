Slack
=====

You can `join our slack`_ network automatically.

Our Slack network has lots of people hanging out and chatting about documentation.
It's the best way to connect with our community,
and to stay in touch with folks you've met at our conferences and meetups.

Our most active Slack channels are listed below. 
This should help you get connected to people with similar interests.
Please also read the Slack guidelines carefully, and remember that our
:doc:`/code-of-conduct` also applies to our Slack.

We don't pay for our Slack, which means that the community has access to only the most
recent 10,000 messages. Not only is paid Slack prohibitively expensive for a community
like ours, but many people seem to feel a freedom in knowing that their words will disappear shortly.

Feel free to send a Pull Request to update `this page`_, if you want to include other channels.

You can `join our slack`_ network if you aren't already a member.

.. note::
    Our Slack includes animated emoji, and other animations are sometimes posted.
    If you think these may be unpleasant for you, you can `disable all animations`_
    in your Slack client.

Default channels
----------------

Everyone who joins the Slack will be added to these channels:

* **#general** - The main channel for documentation related conversation and questions.
* **#watercooler** - For talking about things that are off-topic. Get to know folks other interests that aren't around documentation :)
* **#jobs-posts-only** - Posting jobs. (You can look for jobs in **#career-advice**)
* **#wtd-conferences** - Questions and other thoughts around the :doc:`/conf/index`.
* **#meetups** - Questions and other thoughts about our :doc:`/meetups/index`.
* **#intros** - Introduce yourself! Let people know you're here, and why you care about docs :)

Other useful topical channels
-----------------------------

* **#career-advice** - Should you take that job? Am I being paid enough? Ask here!
* **#markup-the-docs** - Talk about markup languages. Markdown, rST, Asciidoc, etc.
* **#documenting-apis** - Talk about REST API's. Swagger, Apiary, API Blueprint, and other API doc tools.
* **#sphinx** - Talk about the Sphinx documentation generation tool.
* **#flare** - Talk about the Flare documentation toolkit.
* **#confluence** - Talk about everyone's favorite Wiki.
* **#community-showcase** - Announce your projects here! Blog posts, docs, code, products—whatever you make that you're excited to share!
* **#community-help-wanted** - Got an open-source project that needs docs contributors? Looking for open-source communities who will mentor you while you contribute to their docs? This channel is for you! Only for volunteer/unpaid work with open-source projects; companies and paid job postings should continue to use #job-posts-only. 
* **#wtd-weps** - Ask questions about the Write the Docs Enhancement Proposal (WEP) system and brainstorm on pre-proposal ideas to help improve our community processes and governance. 

Location-based channels
-----------------------

We have too many location-based channels to list.
Chances are we have a large group of folks in your area,
so join up and chat with them.
They're a great way to get in touch with your local meetup organizer and community.

Guidelines
----------

Our goal with Write the Docs is to be **the most welcoming community on the internet**.
People who are new to our community in particular should be assisted and welcomed.

Our :doc:`/code-of-conduct` applies to all spaces associated with Write the Docs, which includes our Slack.
In addition, we have a few Slack-specific guidelines:

Social rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Use inclusive language** - Our community is multicultural, multiracial, multigendered, and generally diverse. When posting in channels, avoid using words such as "guys" to address a mixed group. Possible alternatives: "folks", "everyone", "documentarians".
- **We're all documentarians** - The Write the Docs community is much more than a space for technical writers. We welcome everyone who wants to learn more about creating documentation, including developers, testers, customer support agents, technical writers, program/product managers, developer relations specialists, and more.
- **Only participate when you can be constructive** - Try to be constructive in all that you do, and otherwise consider not participating in a conversation.
- **Say hi** - The world is a better place with a flood of hello's.
- **Don't be snarky** - We are all trying the best we can.
- **Be careful with jokes** - You know that you're joking, but some people might take you seriously.
- **If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all**.

Online community issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a specific set of behaviors that is prevalent in online communities that we'd like to address, to make sure our community doesn't fall into these traps. 

Please avoid these behaviors:

- **No Black Sheep** - There may be tools that you don't like. There is a good chance there is someone in the room who either helped create or likes to use that tool. Don't make them feel bad, they are likely just in a different context.
- **Let Me Google That For You (LMGTFY)** - If people ask questions that are simple to answer on Google, still answer them nicely.
- **Question Policing** - Some people might ask incomplete questions that are hard to answer. Ask follow up questions and act in good faith to help them solve their issues.
- **Technology Competitions** - It doesn't matter if your tool is faster or better in some metric. We care about creating great documentation for our users.

No sales-y content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **No Direct Pitches** - Our Slack is not the place for sales pitches. Consider sponsoring one of our :doc:`conferences </conf/index>` instead!
- **No links without context** - If you put a link in the chat without context or explanation, it may be deleted.
- **No Brands** - If you're going to post, post as yourself, not as a brand. We are a community of individuals and we all exist outside of our day jobs and personal brands.

Reporting Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you see people not following our etiquette guidelines,
you have two options:

* Message them privately, and explain why what they said might have been hurtful to someone, referring to this guide.
* Ask a :ref:`moderation-team` member to address the situation, include a link to the conversation if possible.
