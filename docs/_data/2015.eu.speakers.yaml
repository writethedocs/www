- abstract: "<p>Most of the documentation we read today puts a lot of burden on us\
    \ before\nwe have the chance to get to the gist. Abstract and clear concepts are\n\
    replaced by concrete and comprehensive ones. The real values are hindered by\n\
    opaque clouds of facts about tools of trade. As a result, thinking and\nimagination\
    \ are suppressed.</p>\n\n<p>But what if we can write documentation that encourages\
    \ thinking?</p>\n\n<p>Let's look together on what really matters when documenting\
    \ computer\nsystems. We will discuss how a documentation and system design can\
    \ walk hand\nin hand and to improve the communication between both humans and\n\
    machines.</p>\n"
