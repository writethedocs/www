    games accessible and as easy as possible for non-technical, non-programmers. As
    part of our work on the BAFTA-winning video game Night in the Woods (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_in_the_Woods),
    we wrote a narrative game development framework called YarnSpinner (https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner).
    In doing so, we learnt a lot about how to build tools for non-technical writers
    of stories to create interactive and engaging playable narratives. We''d like
    to share what we''ve learned.</p>

    <p>This session explores the best practices for crafting interactive narratives.
    We''ll survey the state of tools (including Twine, YarnSpinner, Ink, and beyond),
    discuss the needs of writers, and look at how interactive narrative content is
    stunningly strange combination of fiction, programming, and self-documenting horror.
    How does it all come together? </p>

    <p>How do we make the complex task of creating stories that need to track state,
    variables, and thousands and thousands of lines of branching dialogue accessible,
    simple, debuggable, traceable, and fun? </p>

    <p>Let''s find out together!</p>'

    defining a strategy for documentation.</p>

    <p>Technical writing or documentation, in general, follows a sort of definitive
    process in all organizations.

    In a perfect world, writers plan, research, interview, organize, write, review,
    incorporate feedback, deliver, and continuously incorporate user''s feedback.</p>

    <p>As a writer, where does our responsibility end? Our primary focus is on creating
    and updating content, but we should not forget about how we can make it more visible
    to our users. Our end-users are looking for information.</p>

    <p>The following steps can help us to become our user''s documentarian:

    - Know your audience

    - Empathize with them

    - Analyze what they need and not what they want

    - Study their behavior and analyze where will they want to get the information

    - Find and develop a way to deliver docs where your audience is most likely to
    search

    - Based on your delivery goal, set up all the resources you need

    - Write and form a network of links for easy navigation

    - Review and incorporate feedback

    - Deliver and integrate your user''s feedback continuously</p>

    <p>It''s not a new way but a unique perspective of writing. It aims to focus on
    being more human in understanding your users'' needs. It''s like a human-centric
    approach to documentation, where you aim for two things: to provide users with
    the information they need and to make it visible to them.</p>'

- abstract: '<p>Minimum Viable Product or MVP is a development technique where a
    new product is introduced in the market with basic features, but enough to get
    the attention of the consumers. </p>

    <p>The MVP technique brings with it a set of characteristics that qualify how
    it fits into the whole startup and entrepreneurial space for building efficient products: </p>

    <ol>

    <li>It comprises of a set of basic features that you use to ascertain early
    on whether customers find the product useful.</li>

    <li>By separating basic features and subsequent add-ons, you bring with it
    a scope to enhance the product in every step of the development. This means you have a defined roadmap set for your product.</li>

    <li>Using the feedback or learning loop, you establish a model of constantly
    getting feedback from your early adopters and initial set of users. This provides the momentum to build consumable features along the way.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>This talk additionally focuses on what writers or documentation experts can contribute as valuable information for an MVP.</p>
    <p>As authored by the Agile/Lean guru, Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup,</p>
    <p>The primary benefit of an MVP is you can gain understanding about your
    customers’ interest in your product without fully developing the product.
    The sooner you can find out whether your product will appeal to customers,
    the less effort and expense you spend on a product that will not succeed in the market.</p>'

    that critical first job - in the software industry. It''s also a great way to
    build a network and establish a reputation in the business. And anybody can contribute
    to open source, right?</p>

    <p>Sure. <em>In theory.</em></p>

    <p>In fact, diversity and inclusion in open source is worse than that of "traditional"
    software. Women, for example, make up ~22% of computer programming professionals,
    but only 3% of Github''s survey respondents identify as female. That''s a problem
    for open source software projects, which draw their strength from the diversity
    of their communities, the knock-on effect is that women and other underrepresented
    groups are even less likely to gain access to careers in technology that rely
    on a great open source portfolio.</p>

    <p>To be successful, and to participate in the economic advancement offered by
    the software industry, all developers everywhere need access to the knowledge
    needed to fully participate in technology. In this talk, we''ll cover the common
    barriers to full participation in the software development industry, identify
    some common myths around knowledge sharing, and share practical research-based
    findings into how to overcome those barriers so that all developers everywhere
    have equal access to the information they need to participate in the knowledge
    economy.</p>

    of writing documentation, we are always told what issues users face on a daily

    testing, and actually witnessed the users issue first hand? </p>

    testing with technical documentation. I will draw upon my experience as a technical

- abstract: '<p>The purpose of this presentation is to give confidence by sharing
    insights from my experience with authoring four books till date. It was not easy
    starting to write by myself and doing a whole technical piece end-to-end however,
    it took persistence and passion to get it done over a course of two years. Nevertheless,
    despite it consumed me as a person and engulfed all my social and personal life;
    I never regretted doing that as it paid well than I imagined - not monetarily,
    more importantly as an achievement and a path leader to beyond my 9-5.</p>

    <p>During this presentation, I want to share my experiences on how I came about
    the whole idea of writing a technical book, what encompassed the journey, and
    most importantly – how it’s not rocket science to get started on a book. People
    only see a book with a name, they don’t see the efforts behind it but then, how
    will they if they’re not sure what it takes to write one? It becomes even more
    challenging to address one self’s aspirations and limitations unless there’s a
    trend setter – which there is not. By sharing my views on why one should do it
    and how they benefit from it I guess at least a handful people will embark on
    the journey and experience the making of an author.</p>

    <p>As key takeaways – I would like to have audience appreciate that writing could
    be looked upon as being an integral part of a good orator or presenter as they
    already have those skills to covert voice to words. Even for an average 9-5 person
    – they can and should take a stab at it and experience what it is like to create
    something extraordinary with the knowledge and thoughts which were in their mind
    alone till date. I would expect that people get motivated and get charged on how
    they can create legacy and leave behind a work of art of which they’ll be proud
    of when they look back in a time in future. </p>'

    projects assume the community have a good understanding of the English language
    and often North American culture as well. This creates barriers for many solution
    providers, who are the gateway to potentially huge markets for your project.</p>

    <p>This talk discusses some of the cultural differences, particularly for people
    from Asia, in using English language API documentation. It suggests some strategies
    to help diverse audiences understand you APIs and create solutions using them.</p>

    <p>The talk will cover not only differences in language but also other cultural
    differences that are often not obvious. For example:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Different expectations about publication formats, release processes, levels
    of support during the development process</li>

    <li>Meeting and communications styles</li>

    <li>Software development workflows, processes, and tools</li>

    <li>Supporting people who are visually impaired will also be briefly discussed.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>As well as discussing these issues, specific suggestions will be provided to
    make API docs accessible for as many people as possible.</p>

    <li>Example(s).</li>
    <li>Deeper practical tips, explanations and justifications for approaches - for use by  information architects, reviewers, and seasoned Documentarians.</li>
    <li>Collated background theory.</li>
