- abstract: '<p>Sometimes we get so caught up in making sure our docs are accurate,
    up to date, and well written that we don''t have time to see how they look from
    an outside perspective. In this talk, I''ll run through how you can gain valuable
    insight into your docs by mapping the journeys of the people who use your docs.</p>

    <p>Customer journey mapping provides a useful framework for thinking about how
    users of your docs actually experience their interactions. It involves thinking
    about how your docs fit within users'' work and what you can do to maximize their
    good feelings when their journey touches your docs.</p>

    <p>To give you a better idea of the process, I''ll present the example of what
    we learned while mapping at Kentico Cloud. Our process was very useful for us
    and consisted of several steps:</p>

    <ol>

    <li>Gather information about who reads our docs.</li>

    <li>Create personas for our readers.</li>

    <li>Meet and go through the journey as each persona.</li>

    <li>Act on the insights.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>I hope that by seeing this example and what we gained from it, you''ll be able
    to see how useful it can be to set aside time to try to see your docs from someone
    else''s point of view.</p>'

    are only, like, 50 percent writing, and 50 percent all the other stuff we have
    to do to make that writing good. Long before we ever get a word on the proverbial
    page, we spend ages getting our heads around our products and the underlying concepts
    that shape them. But how often are those underlying concepts... kind of a mess?
    And how much better would our lives be if we could help design our products so
    they''re simpler, clearer, and easier to communicate to our users? </p>

    <p>Welcome to the wonderful world of content design. Whether you''ve ever heard
    of the discipline or not, it''s a safe bet that it already makes up a healthy

    thinking, narrative building, and language crafting you already do as documentarians
    can make you an incredible asset to your product design team. </p>

    <p>As two former docs folks who have made the jump to content design full time,
    we''ll share the framework we use to communicate the value of our role on Intercom''s

- abstract: '<p>Maybe you''ve always wondered what bridges poetry and tech writing,
    maybe you already know, or maybe you’re thinking about it now for the first time.
    In this talk, I will discuss how the two disciplines of poetry and technical writing
    are the Gemini twins of the Digital Age. As a lifelong student, reader, writer,
    and lover of all things poetry, I realized early in my academic career that poetry
    is what I wanted. I didn’t know how I wanted it, but I wanted it. When I was finally
    approached with the opportunity to be a Technical Writer, I knew it would be a
    good fit, but I never imagined the interdisciplinary overlap. As a Technical Writer
    of user documentation I bring poetry into my work every single day. I’m reminded
    of a poem, a poet, a writer, a theme, a purposeful misspelling, and I see a commonality.
    </p>

    <p>These are some of the similarities I’m reminded of the most, and what I’ll
    be presenting in my talk: </p>

    <ul>

    <li>Creatives &amp; Tech writers: Brief, biographical information on well-known
    creatives who were once Technical Writers. The list may include: Leonardo Da Vinci,
    Thomas Pynchon, George Saunders, and Amy Tan. </li>

    <li>Themes &amp; style guides: “The Crocodile” by Lewis Carroll and its adherence
    to a poetic theme. Both poetic themes and style guides are important tools for
    standardizing tone, diction, and organization for writers. </li>

    <li>Form &amp; structure “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” by e e cummings and the importance
    of form on a page. This poem uses negative space and unique formatting to add
    meaning to the content, while the structure of user documentation is vital to
    the content within any article. </li>

    <li>Poetry &amp; work: “Wild Geese” by Mary Oliver and the beauty of reality,
    making mistakes, and using your imagination to find your place “in the family
    of things”.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>This talk is for people who are interested in dissecting the similarities between
    poetry and technical writing, and who strive to keep their creative brains enabled
    in their daily work.</p>'

    which took a novel approach: "write the docs before the API exists". </p>

    <p>When I first got into software technical writing, I used to think that you
    should include technical writers from the start of a project. That''s still a
    common approach, but as I personally became a more experienced writer, I began
    to find that projects very often changed—as they should, by design, in Agile development.
    The upshot of that for me though was that much of my work on documentation ended
    up being "sunk costs". </p>

    <p>When drawing up our newest API at Onfido, I (by now a "quite technical" technical
    writer) set out with a backend engineer to not only document it from the start,
    but to actually assist in designing it—based on how I envisaged our customers
    would review the documentation, test the API, and interact with it. </p>

    <p>This talk will discuss the lessons we learned along the way, how well the experiment
    worked, and more widely about how software technical writers can bring unique
    expertise to not only write about, but help shape the direction of projects and
    create the best possible developer experience. </p>'

- abstract: '<p>Just a few years ago, the UK’s Government Digital Service (GDS) didn’t
    have a technical writing team. Documentation was often written by technologists
    (if at all) and GDS teams were building so fast they had no choice but to cobble
    docs together with a mix of tools and processes. </p>

    <p>For users, this meant an inconsistent experience. For technologists, this meant
    constant confusion about where and how to document things. And for newly-hired
    technical writers, it meant learning a new toolset every time we moved teams.
    So we decided we needed to overhaul the lot. </p>

    <p>Three years on and GDS uses a docs as code approach for all our docs. We’ve
    debated static site generators, wrangled legacy content, switched hosting options,
    grappled git workflows, introduced and swiftly backtracked on features, and tested
    repeatedly with our users. It’s not perfect, but we’ve learnt an awful lot along
    the way. </p>

    <p>This talk is the story of how docs as code has fundamentally changed the role
    of documentation creators in government, how we side-stepped pitfalls and fell
    head first into others and - if we had the chance - whether we’d do it all again.

- abstract: '<p>The teams behind apps and services are faced with the continuous challenge
    to create customer support documentation that is understandable and up-to-date
    at all times. With this challenge in mind this talk offers tips on planning and
    creating customer support documentation by leveraging the power of empathy at
    every stage. As a key principle in Design Thinking, empathy can be applied not
    only to product development but also to creative projects like designing and building
    a help center. </p>

    <p>Although there has been a lot of talk about the importance of setting aside
    pre-existing assumptions regarding (user) behavior and empathizing with voiced
    out needs instead when writing support documentation, one important aspect has
    been largely ignored in the discussion: Planning and executing support documentation
    projects should be guided by empathy not only towards the users of a product but
    also towards its creators, developers, and support agents. By considering all
    relevant perspectives at all stages of writing documentation, support teams can
    create state-of-the-art help centers that serve their purpose in all relevant
    use cases, from answering customer questions to on-boarding new team members.</p>

    <p>While building a help center alone is a big project that requires creativity
    and dedication, the importance of maintaining its efficiency and accuracy as an
    ongoing task is not always given the attention it deserves in Support teams. By
    choosing to approach such projects with an iterative mindset, writers can continuously
    improve their documentation in response to incoming feedback and relevant user
    data.</p>

    <p>The tips offered in this talk aim to help writers and teams to apply empathy
    and iteration to their documentation projects as a way to improve not only the
    quality of the end product but also the writers’ satisfaction with their work
    in a sustainable manner.</p>'

- abstract: '<h1>Intro section (about 5 minutes)</h1>

    <p>What do I do daily: Technical writer at Unity Technologies. Before that, technical
    writer in an identity and access management software firm. Before that: translated
    software (UI strings, release notes, EULAs, how-tos) for clients like Adome, Kaspersky,
    KING etc.</p>

    <p>What’s my background: Masters in corporate communication and English (in Danish:
    cand.ling.merc) = corporate linguistics.  Non-native speaker of English. Grew
    up in a Danish/Romanian home. Do not speak Romanian; but picked up a lot of language
    differences. So I’ve always been interested in the misunderstandings based on
    speaking non-native languages.</p>

    <p>Why is this talk relevant for documentarians? </p>

    <p>We work in highly international contexts. Most often with English as a shared
    corporate language. And we’re expected to function at a high level of both technical
    and social proficiency in English. In my daily work and socializing with colleagues
    across different disciplines and nationalities, I’m frequently reminded of my
    studies in Business English as a Lingua Franca, which I use in a practical sense
    both when collaborating with colleagues and when writing actual documentation.
    This is where applied linguistics comes in, based on this definition, shamelessly
    stolen from Wikipedia: "[applied linguistics] identifies, investigates, and offers
    solutions to language-related real-life problems"</p>

    <h1>My academic papers that I want to use as a background (about 12 minutes):</h1>

    <p>Bachelor''s’ thesis. “Why is using English as a corporate language not an end-all
    solution to communication issues in SMEs?” (Small-to-medium enterprises)''</p>

    <p>Findings:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>People don’t speak English. They speak their own language with English words.</li>

    <li>We cluster together in perceived like-minded groups (example: Italians, French
    and Spanish; Scandinavians)</li>

    <li>Sometimes, people just don’t like each other</li>

    <li>Shared contexts are more important than language proficiency</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Masters’ thesis: “There are those that speak English very well - and those
    that just speak it very much: a qualitative study of the use of English as a corporate
    language at Copenhagen Business School”.</p>

    <p>Findings: </p>

    <ul>

    <li>If we only focus on correct language, we actually hinder ourselves from doing
    our job</li>

    <li>Shared contexts are more important than language proficiency</li>

    <li>The meaning of “language proficiency” changes according to the context</li>

    </ul>

    <h1>How do I use these findings in my daily work (About 10 minutes):</h1>

    <ul>

    <li>

    <p>When writing: don’t focus on “correct English”, but correct context. Examples:
    don’t use “it will happen”, but “it happens”. More easily parsed. Also = context
    switching: try to assess the context the user is in, not the context of what information
    you got from whom. Information storage is not the same as knowledge retrieval.</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>Be mindful of false friends: (example: sparring = positive in Danish, negative
    in English). Shoutouts to translators!</p>

    </li>

    <li>Explore the language heritage of my subject matter experts. Example: One dev
    = Brazilian. He understands the latin root of most of my words; so when he and
    I talk, it’s actually easier for us both if we use the more complex words.</li>

    <li>Bring forward shared contexts (the feature we’re discussing). </li>

    <li>Also bring forward how we’re speaking our own jargon in English: marketing,
    dev-speak, tech writer communication speak, product management focus etc. We all
    tend to assume that we’re at the same wavelength, but rarely truly remember that
    our discipline dictates our language and our connotation. We might not even mean
    the same thing, when we say "documentation". So openly discuss entry points.</li>

    <li>Practically: when I need documentation input, I ask the shorter question,
    because it’s easier to parse for any speaker: what, why, who, where? (As opposed
    to “please state this”, “please explain”). If I come off as rude: hey, I’m Danish
    - we’re direct. Also, thanks for your help, you’re an absolute star!</li>

    <li>At the interpersonal level: Sometimes, someone might be good at communication
    in the context of work, but not otherwise. Sometimes, it’s not rudeness nor lack
    of proficiency in English; it might just be that the person is speaking their
    own culture with English words. And that’s OK.</li>

    <li>Remember to take things with a grain of salt: not every miscommunication issue
    is because the points above haven’t been addressed or because there’s not enough
    cultural/contextual awareness. Sometimes, people just misunderstand.</li>

- abstract: <p>This talk explores the challenges associated with documenting a project
    with a very difficult subject and having an audience with vastly different backgrounds.
    I started a project two years ago to document a database query language that was
    invented to work with genomic databases. It is an esoteric subject where the knowledge
    was very much in the heads of a small number of people, but needed to be accessible
    to an audience including geneticists, software engineers, bioinformaticians and
    hospital clinicians. We use a mixture of Sphinx (with some adaptations) to bring
    in contributions from people working on the language and the project has grown
    to include contributors from all the backgrounds I mention here. By treating the
    documentation like a code project, we created a process we can work with, but
    this talk is really about the process of translating information within a single
    language and between domains and how to make information accessible without sacrificing
    meaning.</p>
