  abstract: '<p>Simple glossaries are relatively easy to set up for individual projects,
    but they become difficult to manage when you try to scale them - especially when
    trying to scale the management of terms and definitions across multiple platforms,
    projects and even organisations.</p>

    <p>As our organisation grew in size, we quickly saw that we were using different
    terms to describe very similar features across the company''s range of software
    applications. A pressing requirement emerged to efficiently manage the terms that
    we were using. It was important to have a single source of truth for all the terms
    and definitions, and that source of truth had to be created in such a way so that
    it could be adapted to a variety of outputs and formats (websites, API docs, translation
    tools, etc.). This applied not only to software that came into our portfolio via
    acquisitions, but also to new projects being developed in our R&amp;D departments.</p>

    <p>Focusing on the technical writer''s role, this talk will discuss the following
    aspects of my organisation''s terminology management journey:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>The challenges of arriving at consensus over terminology used across multiple
    platforms</li>

    <li>Creating an initial termbase</li>

    <li>How we implemented a machine-readable, single-source, "mega" glossary</li>

    <li>Standardising and automating glossary creation processes</li>

    <li>Ensuring content reuse across different platforms</li>

    <li>Ongoing internationalisation of the glossary</li>

    of delivering superior self-service Support, is well documented. Today’s customers
    are savvy, self-reliant and more than comfortable finding answers to their questions
    online. And they increasingly use self-service as the first point of contact with
    your support organization and, oftentimes, your company. However, as the focus
    and emphasis on self-service support has increased over the years, the cornerstone
    of self-service support has remained consistent. The help center remains the cornerstone
    of self-service support and is overwhelmingly the preferred support channel for
    customers. </p>

    <p>But simply offering your customers a help center is not enough. To ensure you
    are providing your customers with a high-quality self-service experience, one
    that ultimately allows them to resolve their own issues, it is imperative that
    your help documentation, and other instructional content, is easily digestible
    and up-to-date. </p>

    <p>Not only do product screenshots immediately convey to your customers what a
    help article is about, they also make your content more interesting and engaging.
    Your content only has a few seconds to make an impression on your customers, and
    these product visuals make a big difference. Product screenshots allow you to
    break your content into more understandable steps, and allow your customers to
    digest the content in a more simplified way. They increase how engaged your customers
    are with your help articles and increase the likelihood they will find the answer
    they need.  </p>

    <p>Topics covered in the talk will include:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>The importance of product screenshots in your help documentation and the key
    metrics they will help you improve</li>

    <li>The different approaches for including product screenshots in your help documentation
    and when it is best to use each different approach</li>

    <li>Using alerts to automate when your product screenshots, and help documentation,
    has become outdated and an automated process to automatically update your product
    screenshots</li>

    that the journey of creating something so different and creative mattered more
    than the final deliverable, and that the way of reaching product truth is different
    from person to person.</p>

    <p>In this talk I''ll tell you how I created the book and got it published by
    Splunk. Along the way, I''ll explain the Circles of Product Truth model and present
    other ways in which unconventional technical communication and media can bridge
    the gap between different levels of audience knowledge and provide a safe path
    to product truth. Because this, too, is tech writing.</p>'

    for writing, updating, and organizing the product’s documentation. But years of
    rapid growth and product evolution resulted in sprawling docs that are a hodge-podge
    of logical constructions, writing styles, and information types. As the organization’s
    first dedicated technical writers, we were tasked with reorganizing the content
    to help both experienced practitioners who need to find specific information and
    product novices who want to understand the product for their role or organization.
    We had to complete this project before a major launch without additional resources.</p>

    <p>In this presentation, we will share the steps we took to understand our documentation
    and its needs, including how we audited content, analyzed and compared the structure
    to market peers, designed and conducted an internal usability study, and translated
    the results of the study into high impact “quick wins.” We will also share our
    approach for planning the next steps toward improving our documentation and its
    information architecture.</p>

    <p>We will use our experience to highlight questions relevant for any IA and describe
    how we approached the problem. Topics include:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>How do you determine your documentation’s most important information needs?</li>

    they go together on the surface - isn’t one concerned with words and the other
    with pictures?

    But this is a false oversimplification!. Both documentation &amp; UX have the
    same goal: The success of their users.</p>

    <p>Documentation is a crucial part of a user’s experience: it is how users learn
    how to use a product. Therefore, the involvement of documentation earlier in development
    processes makes the product better and more usable. In the effort of influencing
    and getting information within the development process, UX is the ideal stakeholder
    for documentarians to work with. UX teams spend time not only designing workflows
    and layouts, but also doing UI writing. A collaborative relationship between docs
    and UX can help both teams to work more productively and at a higher quality.
    </p>

    <p>Based on collaborative success stories between technical writers and UX, I
    will discuss strategies and techniques for:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Getting early exposure to planned workflows and features</li>

    <li>Contributing to user success through UI copy and onboarding</li>

    <li>Gaining more strategic influence on products through UX collaboration.</li>

    you create. This is especially true for technical documentation, where complex
    concepts and terms that are specific to your product and industry are described.
    As writers, we rely on the style guide, peer review process, and customer feedback
    to gauge our content, but this doesn''t give us the full picture.</p>

    <p>Readability metrics have been around for a long time. Many of them were devised
    before people used computers, and before software existed, so they''re sometimes
    seen as an imperfect means of gauging readability for technical documentation.</p>

    <p>Two years ago in Rebilly, we were starting a major overhaul of the docs, and
    needed to document most of the product. I was interested in readability metrics
    and the early insights they could provide. Instead of waiting for reviews or customer
    feedback, I could proactively make changes and improve the content. Before this
    point I had never found a good tool for this.</p>

    <p>I got chatting with my colleague, John, who was also interested in this area.
    John created an awesome tool that outputs data for each documentation change based
    on several metrics. And, for the last two years we''ve been learning from these
    metrics and using them to shape our content.</p>

  abstract: '<p>In this proposal, I argue for a reader-centered, bottom-up approach
    to doc restructuring. To make my case, I draw parallels from the worlds of urban
    design and architecture, citing examples of how top-down approaches often ignore
    the needs of the people (readers and residents) who actually use an artifact.</p>

    <p>The documentarian rarely inherits a perfectly structured set of docs.

    Information structures are in a constant flux. Applications change, as do reader
    demands. People leave; organizations re-organize; information plans get abandoned
    in states of partial completion.

    When a new writer joins,

    everything may seem haphazard, confusing, and inhuman, like a dystopian city.</p>

    <p>When approaching these cities of decaying information, a temptation is to take
    a step back and start rearranging from the top down. Or maybe just rewriting the
    whole thing.

    I argue that this attitude often benefits writers more than readers.

    What good is the birds-eye view for the person who is walking on the street?

    Without testing the docs and using the application, how can we understand what
    readers need?</p>

    <p>This talk advocates for the ground-up approach to information restructuring.

    Instead of onboarding sessions, experiment and tinker.

    Some bottom-up strategies include:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Testing and fixing key documents (like maintaining important intersections)</li>

    <li>Gradually exploring how documents communicate with each other (like developing
    important lines of public transportation)</li>

    <li>Making small fixes to links and sentences all over the place (like fixing
    potholes).</li>

    </ul>

    <p>In this process, documentarians develops a wider focus, which in turn gives
    them the knowledge to make effective, high-level changes later.</p>'

    strategy and product content in the fast-paced world of tech startups, most strategic
    decisions have been based on the goal of getting as many users to look at my content
    as possible. But recently in Mews, we have been talking more about User Disengagement.
    It’s a concept that will be familiar to those in touch with the world of product
    design: in our case, we want hoteliers and guests to use our property management
    system as little as possible. We envision a predictive system with no screens.
    Imagine that! But how does this ambition translate to product documentation—and
    how can we measure the success of documentation when disengagement, rather than
    engagement, is the goal?  </p>

    <p>This really got me thinking. About how we write and structure our documentation
    and how we measure its success. At Mews, we decided to support both long-form
    product documentation and shorter FAQ-style articles written by Customer Support.
    We imposed a clear structure, including linkable navigational elements, and organizational
    system titles, tags and subheadings. We brought our documentation into the product
    as much as possible. And we created new reports, relying less on page views and
    visits, and looking more closely at bounce rates, self-service and case deflection.  </p>

    <p>This talk will condense everything I’ve learned about how the concept of user
    disengagement can improve product documentation, including: </p>

    <ul>

    <li>Why user disengagement should be your guiding principle for docs </li>

    <li>Why many traditional content metrics don’t work </li>

    <li>How to write documentation that’s easier and faster to use </li>

    the past year. While some tech writers have jumped right in, others have found
    themselves unsure, overwhelmed, or even consciously disengaging because of concerns.</p>

    <p>My aim in this talk is to provide technical writers with a conceptual toolkit
    to help guide their ethical decision making about how and where to use generative
    AI tools. In doing so, I want to go beyond the valid, commonly-voiced concerns
    about shortcomings of the tools themselves—such as about toxicity, bias, unreliability,
    and risks of ‘hallucination’. Specifically, I’ll zoom in on concrete ethical challenges
    around the use of generative AI tools in three types of situation that will be
    familiar to many tech writers: </p>

    <ol>

    <li>the production of documentation; </li>

    <li>the use of documentation; and </li>

    <li>professional development and responsibility. </li>

    </ol>

    <p>For each of these cases, I will foreground specific ethical issues that a tech
    writer might run into, and will point to how, and the extent to which, they can
    be addressed.</p>

    <p>Generative AI tools are likely to have a huge continued impact on the technical
    writing craft and profession over the years to come. By building a conceptual
    toolkit, my aim is to empower tech writers to feel better equipped and more confident
