    community \u2014 and it\u2019s not hard to figure out why. According to the World Health
    Organization, there are over one billion people globally who need an assistive
    device. With these statistics, organizations and open source projects alike
    realize that they could be unintentionally locking these people out of their
    products. As a result, they adjust their developer workflows. And it often ends
    there, at the product. Documentation is left out of the conversation.</p>\n

    <p>If documentation is meant to serve as a tool for learning and comprehension,
    then it must be included in those conversations. After all, we want to write
    docs that are truly for everyone \u2014 regardless of the technology they use to
    read it.</p>\n

    <p>In this talk, we\u2019ll look at how assistive technology consumes documentation and

    glamorous, and tends not to get much love: the humble release note.</p>

    When I joined my current company back in September 2017, I noticed we didn\u2019t
    have a consistent format for our release notes, and they were often clunky and
    difficult to understand. And when I did a bit of research to see if there were
    any generally accepted formats, I was surprised at how little guidance I found.</p>

    I realised I had plenty of my own ideas about what made a good release note
    (from reading and writing many over the years), so I gathered them together and
    gradually formed them into a style guide. Drawing from this, I\u2019ll talk about:</p>\n

    <ul>\n<li>making release notes easier to write \u2010 and read \u2010 by grouping them into
    categories and then using templates to write them</li>\n
    <li>how you can improve readability with a few simple style tweaks</li>\n
    <li>viewing release notes as a ready\u2010made opportunity to show your users the hard
    work you\u2019ve put into your product \u2010 the bugs you\u2019ve fixed, and the suggestions
    you\u2019ve listened to</li>\n</ul>"

    \"She Who Figures Out What We Need To Do About Our Documentation And Does It\"
    is too wordy for HR. I work in a product unit of about 350 people creating
    software for developers, very few of them skilled writers or native speakers of
    English. My role is to figure out how we can produce good documentation.</p>

    <p>I have a problem of scale: I can\u2019t do all of the technical writing we need. So
    instead, I\u2019ve become a contagious documentarian. Over the last year, I\u2019ve
    <strike>infected</strike> taught technical writing to over 200 people around my
    company. My 3 1/2 hour course, \"Technical Writing for Techies\", is popular, and
    seems to be effective. There\u2019s been a noticeable improvement in the writing
    we\u2019re producing, and (even better) an awareness that good writing is an
    achievable, even enjoyable, thing.</p>

    <p>When I describe the course formally, I tend to list attendee objectives such as:</p>\n
    <ul>\n<li>Think about the audience and how to write for them.</li>\n
    <li>Study and practice different writing techniques.</li>\n
    <li>Understand and use a style guide.</li>\n
    <li>Learn ways to improve word choice and sentence structure.</li>\n
    <li>Study the commonest mistakes that non\u2010native speakers make in English and how
      to correct them. (etc)</li>\n</ul>

    <p>And I do cover all of those topics. But just between us, my real objectives for
    my students are:</p>\n
    <ul>\n<li>Stay awake.</li>\n
    <li>Feel welcome and relaxed enough to participate openly.</li>\n
    <li>Finish the course feeling competent and capable about writing.</li>\n
    <li>Trust the Information Architect enough to come to her with future problems.</li>\n
    <li>Want to be part of a community of documentarians.</li>\n</ul>

    <p>I\u2019ll talk about the course structure, some of the ways I\u2019ve designed and
    delivered it to meet both sets of objectives, how it has evolved over time,
