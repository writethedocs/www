    \ note.</p>\nWhen I joined my current company back in September 2017, I noticed\
    \ we didn\u2019t have a consistent format for our release notes, and they were\
    \ often clunky and difficult to understand. And when I did a bit of research to\
    \ see if there were any generally accepted formats, I was surprised at how little\
    \ guidance I found.</p>\nI realised I had plenty of my own ideas about what made\
    \ a good release note (from reading and writing many over the years), so I gathered\
    \ them together and gradually formed them into a style guide. Drawing from this,\
    \ I\u2019ll talk about:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>making release notes easier to write\
    \ \u2010 and read \u2010 by grouping them into categories and then using templates\
    \ to write them</li>\n <li>how you can improve readability with a few simple style\
