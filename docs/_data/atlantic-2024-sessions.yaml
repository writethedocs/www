    technical writers should drive the onboarding process in their company. In my
    role as Head of Documentation and Training, I realized that we had a problem with
    onboarding. Customers were taking too long to onboard and at the end of it, they
    didn’t really know how to use the product. After analyzing our customer onboarding
    sessions, I realized that much of the flow could be automated into content that
    turned the customer onboarding experience from a Support Agent-led experience
    to a self-service experience.</p>

    <p>In this presentation, I will share with you my process for identifying information
    that can be converted into content to create a self-service onboard process for
    your customers. Through this process, we were able to reduce the amount of time
    it took to onboard customers and our users were able to achieve more at the end
    of their onboarding while using fewer resources.  </p>

    <p>The goal of this talk is to help you:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Onboard your customers faster with content</li>

    <li>Reduce the effort it takes to onboard</li>

    <li>Convert more users into champions</li>

    for Everyone, Everywhere</strong>," we explore the transformative power of accessibility
    in documentation. As technical writers, technologists, and people managers at
    AVEVA, we''ve spearheaded initiatives to integrate accessibility into our documentation
    and documentation portal. We’ve moved from a mere <strong>50%</strong> WCAG compliance
    to nearly <strong>97%</strong> WCAG compliance within months. This journey began
    with a challenge: our legacy portal was a maze of inaccessible content, post-merger.
    Fueled by a drive to make information universally accessible, we embarked on a
    mission to redefine our content strategy.</p>

    <p>Our talk will detail practical steps taken to enhance accessibility, from implementing
    user-friendly widgets to incorporating alt-text in images and beyond. Attendees
    will learn about:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Integrating accessibility without disrupting existing workflows.</li>

    <li>Leveraging user feedback to prioritize accessibility improvements.</li>

    <li>Simple, impactful accessibility enhancements that can be applied immediately.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>This session will resonate with documentarians seeking to make their content
    more inclusive, ensuring that our methods can be adapted regardless of the tools

    <p>To challenge the notion that GraphQL documentation starts and ends with a schema,
    this session will advocate for interactive documentation as a solution. The presentation
    will start by defining interactive documentation. One example of interactive documentation
    is embedding usable code samples linked to users'' sandbox environments, allowing
    them to test their integration directly from the docs. The goal is to inspire
    other Technical Writers and DevEx teams to think outside the box and provide rich

    and maintaining documentation for a software product. It serves as a blueprint
    for the documentation process, detailing the scope, content types, user journeys,
    priorities, and content involved in creating comprehensive documentation for the
    product. </p>

    <p>At OutSystems, until recently, we adopted a feature-driven approach without
    a solid documentation plan for documenting product enhancements. This approach
    was less user-centric and more product-focused, leading to limited collaboration
    with teams like UX or training. As a result, our documentation was less comprehensive,
    and felt disconnected from the user''s journey throughout the product.</p>

    <p>Hence, early last year, for all our significant product enhancements and new
    features, we started developing a comprehensive documentation plan that resembled
    the real-life journey of an OutSystems user. This involved close collaboration
    with the Research and Development (R&amp;D), UX, and training teams, which helped
    us gain insights into our users'' needs. This increased understanding enabled
    us to create a more user-centric documentation set that enhanced our product''s
    usability and contributed to a positive user experience. </p>

    <p>Based on our experiences, we''ll present how developing a solid documentation
    plan enabled us to:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Spend adequate time researching and mapping the user journey before creating
    our first drafts.</li>

    <li>Prioritize content delivery so the team does not face burnout and still delivers
    the most helpful content to our users.</li>

    <li>Deliver content that covers the user''s knowledge needs.</li>

    <p>The cherry on top is that we will share a usable template of our documentation

    <p>Linguistics is the study of language. That’s pretty broad though—not everyone
    realizes it, but there are many subsets of the field. In this talk, you''ll learn
    how each branch of linguistics can help you write and communicate more effectively:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Semantics: Logic and meaning </li>

    <li>Do you know the difference between vague and ambiguous writing?</li>

    <li>Syntax: The structure of sentences</li>

    <li>What is a complementizer and why should you use them?</li>

    <li>Sociolinguistics: Social factors like class, race, and gender</li>

    <li>Your teachers were wrong about a lot of things. You can in fact end a sentence
    in a preposition! </li>

    <li>Morphology: Word formation </li>

    <li>When you write, do you ever think about how some words in English can mean
    multiple things? (Spoiler: this is called syncretism) </li>

    </ul>

    <p>You’ll learn through many real-life examples to guide you beyond theory and
    into practice. Even if you’ve never learned about linguistics before, images and
    metaphors throughout the presentation will help solidify concepts. The perfect
    attendee is anyone who communicates at work; no need to be a linguist, or even
    a technical writer.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, you’ll learn how to communicate efficiently, unambiguously, and
    accessibly. By the end of the talk, you’ll feel challenged and energized to continue
    learning about how language fundamentally works.</p>'

    </p>

    <p>These are all things Kong’s team of three technical writers are responsible
    for. As release cadence increased, we found we had less time for all these other
    “hats” that writers wear, but demand for technical diagrams in our docs was still
    growing. After testing out tools built for graphic designers and hacky Google
    Slide diagram workarounds, we knew we needed a solution that would make it easier
    to create, maintain, and share diagrams. </p>

    <p>This pivotal decision led us to embrace Mermaid.js, an open-source Java Script
    library that simplifies diagram creation through a markdown-like syntax. This
    tool was perfectly suited for our small, agile team, enabling us to produce easy-to-maintain
    diagrams efficiently. The straightforward usability of Mermaid.js facilitated
    its rapid adoption not only within our docs team, but also across various departments.
    Its integration reached beyond internal processes; even some of our customers
    took notice and incorporated it into their docs and our engineering team added
    it to one of our products. </p>

    <p>This presentation delves deeper than just discussing Mermaid.js as a tool.
    It explores how innovative thinking can empower docs teams to influence far-reaching
    aspects of a business. We’ll examine how our small team’s shift in approach not
    only enhanced our docs, but sparked changes in product development and customer
    engagement. Through our case study of adopting Mermaid.js, we aim to demonstrate
    that stepping outside of conventional boundaries can lead to substantial organizational
    impacts, illustrating the profound influence that docs writers can have beyond
    just documentation.</p>'

  abstract: '<p>We use Templates in our documentation to force a similar style on
    the sections and pages of our documents so that the only difference is the content.
    This uniformity makes it easier for our readers to scan our documents. It also
    makes it easier for Search Engines to parse them. And, incidentally, it makes
    it easier for us to write them.</p>

    <p>At its most basic, a Template lays out information that provides an outline
    for a document type or subtype. A template for a Programmer''s Guide is its outline.
    A HowTos’ template defines the HowTo’s approach on how to use the product''s features,
    preferably in the order in which they would be used to get the product up and
    running. A feature’s template is a list of Tutorials on how to use the feature
    (again, in the order in which to use them). A Tutorial template (among the smallest
    particles of a document) provides common sections that outline how to prepare
    for and perform one or more related tasks to accomplish one goal in using one
    feature. </p>

    <p>In this presentation, I intend to:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Describe Tutorial templates. Since they are more universal in nature and less
    dependent on the contents of the product, they can be more easily presented in
    a more detailed form than other Templates types.</li>

    <li>Provide examples of Tutorials from the mid-20th century to today. </li>

    <li>Provide background information on why I believe the Tutorial Templates I will
    show you are among the best.</li>
