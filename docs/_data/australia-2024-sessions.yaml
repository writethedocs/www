  abstract: '<p>Datadog is a monitoring company, and we excel at collecting discrete
    data about systems to make them better. However, collecting meaningful feedback
    from our technical documentation was a challenge. Getting feedback on whether
    your docs are helpful to users is difficult. Standard metrics like conversion
    (when there’s no checkout process) or time spent (longer sessions may indicate
    difficulty) don’t apply well to documentation. </p>

    <p>In an effort to get better feedback, we implemented a documentation survey
    six years ago which allowed users to rank the content and include a screenshot
    of their issues, but it didn’t empower them to provide actionable feedback. Our
    documentation survey required deliberate intervention to refine its structure,
    incorporate additional logic, and benefit from a user researcher’s perspective
    to enhance the flow and ensure a seamless user experience. </p>

    <p>Technical documentation should not be a barrier to understanding. No one (or
    at least we hope no one) has ever said “the documentation was thorough, but I
    wish it had been more bland and boring”. Instead, we wanted to open the floodgates,
    encourage users to provide meaningful feedback, and even feel empowered to contribute
    to our open source <a href="https://github.com/Datadog/documentation">documentation
    repository</a>.</p>'

  abstract: '<p>Ever received prickly feedback from a subject matter expert to your
    review of their doc? Or received vague suggestions like “make this better” and
    thought, “how?” Off-target or unintentionally insensitive comments can derail
    collaboration, especially between technical writers, developers, and non-writers.

    When reviewing a colleague’s work, you want to improve the content while recognizing
    the author’s effort. On the flip side, as the author, you often need feedback
    from stakeholders who may not communicate effectively or even understand the writing
    process.

    In this session, you’ll learn how to give precise, respectful feedback and how
    to ask for—and handle—constructive criticism. We’ll share practical tips for navigating
    feedback challenges from a diverse range of stakeholders like developers, product
    owners, authors, and anyone else who wants to stick their oar in.</p>'

    by both curiosity AND altruism. </p>\n<p>I want to explain why translating developers’
    explanations of software into “what’s that mean for me” for end users has a lot
    in common with writing a well-structured news story. </p>\n<p>Some further enticing
    bullet points (because if you can’t get meta in this context, when can you?!):
    </p>\n<p>• Specific writing techniques taught in journalism school that can become
    part of your technical writing skillset.\n• Things journalism and advertisement
    copywriting definitely DON’T have in common with technical writing – and yet,
    what tips from these disciplines you might find useful. \nBONUS: How the above
    can help you identify and ‘correct’ a particular feature of many AI-written documents.\n•
    What the research says about the link between emotions and understanding instructions.\n•
    Uncovering the best motivation to be a better technical writer.</p>\n<p>All the
    answers? Definitely not. But it's always a good thing to throw around some questions!</p>"

    potato farming?</p>

    <p>Lana and a small group of colleagues at Shippit decided to put generative AI
    to the test. We needed a bunch of developer documentation written last week, we
    had some basic docs that we thought would be a great starting point, and we had
    two days to work on whatever we liked. Generative AI was just the thing we needed
    to deliver results.</p>

    <p>And results were delivered. Of sorts. This talk covers which LLMs we considered,
    what content we gave the tool, and what we didn''t, the prompts we used to get
    results, and the results themselves. Lana will also discuss the benefits and drawbacks
    of this approach to documentation, and - if the demo gods are with us - throw
    in a live demo or two.</p>'

    of naming guidelines from management and stakeholders, both the discovery process

    rules vs. loose guidance\n- Overall consistency vs. necessary differences in approach
    between business units\n- Grandfathering existing practice vs. starting fresh\n-
    Meaningfulness and searchability vs. uniqueness (e.g. including IDs in names)\n-
    Detailed guidance vs. quick reference value\n- Addressing current project scope

    of learning for those who struggle with reading, comprehension, or prefer visual
    learning.\nIt was time to make a change, so we invested in making short videos
    instead of the previous hour-long videos or re-purposed webinars. Now, people
    can snack video instead of eating a meal.\nIn this talk, I will cover the following:\n•
    \  Reasons behind our approach with looking at how different generations learn
    and the importance of learning accessibility. \n•   Explore the video foundations,
    such as scripts, as it is still important to have written words. \n•   Look at
    the learner’s mental models and how bite-sized learning can be easily digested.
    \n•   Give an overview of the production process that you can implement.\nAnd
    finally, it is showtime and we will watch 2 short videos.</p>"

    talk, we'll see how open-source documentarians have harnessed their diverse voices
    to craft documentation inclusive of all identities, including gender representations

    insights to implement these inclusive standards in their work, ensuring their

    It is beautiful and intuitive and a joy to experience, very much like excellent

    <p>As technical documentarians, you are also developer advocates. You advocate
    TO developers and FOR developers. You have the privilege of contributing directly
    to developers’ experience (DX), not only with your documentation but also with
    their experience and perception of the wider product, system or tool the documentation
    supports.</p>

    <p>While we say in UX “Don’t Make me Think”, we in fact always think. When Daniel
    Kahneman talks about “Thinking Fast and Slow”, it is your users’ Thinking Fast
    system that shapes the developer experience of your product and its documentation.</p>

    <p>What then, do Thinking Fast and Don’t Make me Think, have in common? And how
    do these connect with UX, DX and documentation?</p>'

    Now entire business models are on the brink of or in the midst of revolutionary
    change. New assembly lines with AI overseers and automated quality assurance.
    Software systems that write and review legal documents. Virtual researchers that
    schedule and conduct interviews, analyse the results and make design recommendations.
    News corporations that abandon old-style journalism in favour of prompted outputs
    from compliant bots. Content created by machines predicting what the content would
    be if humans were producing it.</p>
