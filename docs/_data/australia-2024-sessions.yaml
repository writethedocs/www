  abstract: '<p>Datadog is a monitoring company, and we excel at collecting discrete
    data about systems to make them better. However, collecting meaningful feedback
    from our technical documentation was a challenge. Getting feedback on whether
    your docs are helpful to users is difficult. Standard metrics like conversion
    (when there’s no checkout process) or time spent (longer sessions may indicate
    difficulty) don’t apply well to documentation. </p>

    <p>In an effort to get better feedback, we implemented a documentation survey
    six years ago which allowed users to rank the content and include a screenshot
    of their issues, but it didn’t empower them to provide actionable feedback. Our
    documentation survey required deliberate intervention to refine its structure,
    incorporate additional logic, and benefit from a user researcher’s perspective
    to enhance the flow and ensure a seamless user experience. </p>

    <p>Technical documentation should not be a barrier to understanding. No one (or
    at least we hope no one) has ever said “the documentation was thorough, but I
    wish it had been more bland and boring”. Instead, we wanted to open the floodgates,
    encourage users to provide meaningful feedback, and even feel empowered to contribute
    to our open source <a href="https://github.com/Datadog/documentation">documentation
    repository</a>.</p>
    
    <p>In this session, I’ll share the journey of implementing a documentation survey and 
    fixing it by dissecting the survey mechanism, enhancing feedback paths, updating our 
    survey design, and integrating survey results with our data analytics platform.</p>'

  abstract: '<p>Ever received vague review suggestions like “make this better” 
  and thought “how?” Or received a prickly response to your review comments from
  an engineer/author and wondered “why?” Off-target or unintentionally insensitive
  comments can derail collaboration, especially between technical writers, 
  developers, and non-writers. </p>
  
  <p>When reviewing a colleague’s work, you want to improve the content while 
  recognizing the author’s effort. On the flip side, as the author, you often need 
  feedback from stakeholders who may not communicate effectively or even understand
  the writing process.</p>
  
  <p>In this session, you’ll learn how to give precise, respectful feedback and how to 
  ask for—and handle—constructive criticism. We’ll share practical tips for navigating
  feedback challenges from a diverse range of stakeholders like developers, product 
  owners, authors, and anyone else who wants to stick their oar in.</p>

  <p>This presentation is essential for anyone involved in document reviews. Drawing 
  on thousands of reviews from The Good Docs Project’s technical writers, we provide 
  actionable strategies for using tools like Google Docs, Word, LibreOffice, Pages, 
  GitHub, and GitLab. We’ll cover one-person reviews and managing conflicting comments 
  from multiple stakeholders.</p>
  
  <p>Developers, writers, and docs-as-code practitioners alike will benefit from techniques
  that foster smoother collaboration and improve documentation quality. You’ll leave 
  with practical, ready-to-use tips for feedback and communication that you can start 
  using straight away. </p>'

    path to this point.</p>\n<p>This presentation will cover how the lack of technical
    background can become your technical writing superpower, as long as you’re driven
    by both curiosity AND altruism. </p>\n<p>I want to explain why translating developers’
    explanations of software into “what’s that mean for me” for end users has a lot

    bullet points (because if you can’t get meta in this context, when can you?!):</p>
    
    <ul>

    <li>Specific writing techniques taught in journalism school that can become
    part of your technical writing skillset.</li>
    <li>Things journalism and advertisement copywriting definitely DON’T have in 
    common with technical writing – and yet, what tips from these disciplines you might find useful. BONUS: How the above
    can help you identify and ‘correct’ a particular feature of many AI-written documents.</li>
    <li>What the research says about the link between emotions and understanding instructions.</li>
    <li>Uncovering the best motivation to be a better technical writer.</li></ul>

    going to be first up against the wall when the AI revolution comes. So what if
    we just took the opportunity to get a large language model to write all our documentation
    for us, and we can sit back and enjoy all that spare time before we have to learn
    potato farming?</p>

    <p>Lana and a small group of colleagues at Shippit decided to put generative AI
    to the test. We needed a bunch of developer documentation written last week, we
    had some basic docs that we thought would be a great starting point, and we had
    two days to work on whatever we liked. Generative AI was just the thing we needed
    to deliver results.</p>

    <p>And results were delivered. Of sorts. This talk covers which LLMs we considered,
    what content we gave the tool, and what we didn''t, the prompts we used to get
    results, and the results themselves. Lana will also discuss the benefits and drawbacks
    of this approach to documentation, and - if the demo gods are with us - throw
    in a live demo or two.</p>'

  abstract: "<p>Organisations can be very heterogeneous in their naming conventions
    and in their naming needs. How do we go about developing naming guidelines in
    these cases? Different business units may be siloed and have strong standards
    and long-established conventions, and these standards often contradict.</p>
    <p>A recent project at CSIRO developing IT naming guidelines has provided me 
    with a template for any future such projects.</p>
    <p>To succeed in getting buy-in for the adoption of naming guidelines from 
    management and stakeholders, both the discovery process and the final deliverables
    must carefully balance factors such as:</p>
   <ul> 
    <li>Prescriptive rules vs. loose guidance</li>
    <li>Overall consistency vs. necessary differences in approach
    between business units</li>
    <li>Grandfathering existing practice vs. starting fresh</li>
    <li>Meaningfulness and searchability vs. uniqueness (e.g. including IDs in names)</li>
    <li>Detailed guidance vs. quick reference value</li>
    <li>Addressing current project scope vs. later scalability to organisation-wide guidelines</li>
    </ul>
   <p>The insights from this project are interesting because (at project kick-off) the organisation
    was an outlier in how disparate the approaches of different business units towards naming and 
    categorising assets were (even within IT), and also how different their needs were. </p>"

    learning.</p>
    <p>It was time to make a change, so we invested in making short videos
    instead of the previous hour-long videos or re-purposed webinars. Now, people
    can snack video instead of eating a meal.</p>
    
    <p>In this talk, I will cover the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Reasons behind our approach with looking at how different generations learn
    and the importance of learning accessibility. </li>
    <li> Explore the video foundations, such as scripts, as it is still important 
    to have written words. </li>
    <li>Look at the learner’s mental models and how bite-sized learning can be easily digested.</li>

  abstract: <p>Open Source thrives on the diversity of its global contributors, which
    has driven the creation of some of the most inclusive documentation practices
    in the industry. Yet, nearly 80% of the global tech community remains underrepresented
    and faces numerous inclusivity barriers, extending beyond just language. In this
    talk, we'll see how open-source documentarians have harnessed their diverse voices
    to craft documentation inclusive of all identities, including gender representations
    and multilingual accessibility. By the end of this talk, attendees will gain practical
    insights to implement these inclusive standards in their work, ensuring their
    documentation is welcoming and accessible to all.</p>

    <p>This talk highlights a critical issue in the tech industry - THE LACK OF INCLUSIVITY. 
    While this problem spans multiple sectors, we will focus specifically on documentation. 
    We'll explore how language barriers, gender biases, and accessibility gaps have 
    historically excluded many from fully engaging with technical content. We'll also 
    look at how some of the most successful open-source communities, such as Kubernetes 
    and the Linux Foundation, have faced inclusivity challenges before, how they have 
    tackled them head-on, and what we can learn from their experiences.</p>

    It is beautiful and intuitive and a joy to experience, very much like excellent

    <p>As technical documentarians, you are also developer advocates. You advocate
    TO developers and FOR developers. You have the privilege of contributing directly
    to developers’ experience (DX), not only with your documentation but also with
    their experience and perception of the wider product, system or tool the documentation
    supports.</p>

    <p>While we say in UX “Don’t Make me Think”, we in fact always think. When Daniel
    Kahneman talks about “Thinking Fast and Slow”, it is your users’ Thinking Fast
    system that shapes the developer experience of your product and its documentation.</p>

    <p>What then, do Thinking Fast and Don’t Make me Think, have in common? And how
    do these connect with UX, DX and documentation?</p>'

    <p>Once upon a time, jobs became redundant little by little. Switchboard operators

    Now entire business models are on the brink of or in the midst of revolutionary
    change. New assembly lines with AI overseers and automated quality assurance.
    Software systems that write and review legal documents. Virtual researchers that
    schedule and conduct interviews, analyse the results and make design recommendations.
    News corporations that abandon old-style journalism in favour of prompted outputs
    from compliant bots. Content created by machines predicting what the content would
    be if humans were producing it.</p>
