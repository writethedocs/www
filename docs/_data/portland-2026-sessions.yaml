  abstract: '<p>For the first nine years I worked in tech, I used Git the way many
    people do: just enough to feel competent, but not enough to recover if anything
    went sideways. I had my fair share of <code>git rebase</code> disasters, with
    panic setting in, then me deleting the repo and re-cloning to start fresh.</p>

    <p>When I discovered <code>git worktree</code>, I realized I''d been stubbornly
    avoiding a lot of valuable Git features. I finally researched commands I''d ignored
    or avoided because they seemed too complicated, and realized there were many that
    would have saved me trouble, heartache, and wasted time over the years.</p>

    <p>This talk is a writer-friendly tour of the Git commands I avoided for years,
    and the calm workflows they unlock. We''ll cover practical tools like <code>git
    worktree</code> (stop switching branches constantly), <code>git reflog</code>
    (your safety net), and <code>git rerere</code> (resolve the same conflict once
    instead of repeatedly).</p>

    <p>I''ll anchor these concepts in real docs-as-code scenarios. By the end, you''ll
    have concrete techniques you can use today to reduce friction and anxiety in your
    documentation workflows, especially when juggling multiple changes at once.</p>'

  abstract: '<p>When I transitioned from software documentation to writing commercialization
    strategies for federally funded research and development projects, I expected
    to learn "business skills." Instead, I discovered that the documentation skills
    I already had—audience analysis, information architecture, and iterative refinement—were
    exactly what worked in high-stakes environments where skeptical reviewers decide
    whether to fund a technical idea.</p>

    <p>Over several years of writing proposals and commercialization plans for computer
    vision, scientific visualization, medical imaging, and data &amp; analytics projects
    at Kitware, I''ve applied documentation approaches in contexts where they aren''t
    typically recognized. I''ve had to translate complex research for review panels
    spanning physicists, program managers, and domain experts, often with limited
    time to evaluate long, technically dense proposals. I''ve iterated on technical
    narratives where structure and clarity mattered more than adding detail, and where
    each revision cycle directly affected whether reviewers understood the core innovation.</p>

    <p>This talk shares concrete lessons from decision-facing technical communication
    that strengthen any technical narrative. I''ll walk through real scenarios and
    show artifacts such as discriminators tables, concept diagrams, and structural
    patterns that help readers quickly grasp value when they are skeptical or time-constrained.
    Rather than focusing on grants themselves, the talk centers on transferable documentation
    principles that proved most effective beyond traditional manuals and reference
    pages.</p>'

    time—stop me if you’ve heard this one before—they had two different docs presences
    that did not necessarily complement each other in terms of either coverage or
    UX. In fairness, there was a reason for this.</p>

    <p>Bluesky is both the name of my employer and the name of what nearly everyone
    thinks of as our primary product. For this reason, it’s been necessary for us
    to have dedicated Bluesky docs, so people wanting to create bots and third-party
    clients can find implementation patterns for these sorts of features that are
    common to most social networks.</p>

    <p>Our real primary product, however, is the Atmosphere. The Atmosphere is the
    ecosystem of the AT Protocol, a new way of building and managing social applications
    that work more like the web: open, interoperable, and not controlled by a single
    corporation. Bluesky APIs are almost all narrowly-scoped versions of Atmosphere
    APIs, implementing only the Bluesky Lexicon out of all the Lexicons in our network.
    </p>

    <p>In this talk, you’ll learn about the decisions we made when rewriting and relaunching
    the Atmosphere docs with the goal of being able to subsume the dedicated Bluesky
    docs into a single point of entry. You’ll see how we’ve designed interfaces to
    our Lexicons that make them look less like an intimidating API reference, and
    more like an app catalog. And you’ll get to post about it!</p>'

    documentation set for a comprehensive security and log management product. </p>

    <p>The content was often packed with useful detail, but it assumed a level of
    context many end users did not yet have. On paper, almost everything was there.
    In practice, however, many users still struggled with the same questions: Where
    do I start? Am I in the right place? And what am I supposed to do next?</p>

    <p>Instead of rewriting the documentation from scratch, I redesigned its structure.
    I built an information architecture that maps content to the user journey from
    “nothing installed” to “operational outcomes.” My team and I then defined a set
    of ten core knowledge pillars that span the full journey. Each pillar became a
    stable zone with a clear purpose, explicit boundaries, and a “definition of done,”
    so users could orient themselves and move forward with confidence.</p>

    <p>This talk shares:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>What we tried and learned through iteration</li>

    <li>How knowledge pillars helped us design documentation that supports wayfinding

    and validated the journey</li>

    <p>You''ll hear about:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>The 5 quality dimensions that actually matter for developer docs (and why
    "freshness" kills you faster than you think)</li>

    <li>Specific patterns of documentation rot: deprecated methods that copy-paste

    <li>What AI can reliably detect vs. where it hallucinates (spoiler: it''s great

    <li>A framework for prioritizing fixes when you have 47 issues and time to fix

    No one knows. Moderators frantically search the Help Center on behalf of the creator,
