    The SoD program has three goals:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Improve documentation in open source projects</li>

    <li>Create opportunities for technical writers to participate in open source projects</li>

    <li>Expand our knowledge of effective metrics for evaluating open source documentation</li>

    </ul>

    <p>2021 was the third year of the Season of Docs program, and the first year where
    projects were asked to explicitly state the problems they expected their documentation
    projects to solve and to outline the metrics they would use to evaluate the success
    of their documentation projects. </p>

    <p>In this talk, we’ll share what we learned about documentation metrics through
    the 30 case studies completed by Season of Docs projects: what worked, what didn’t
    work, and what’s too soon to tell. We’ll also share what projects learned about
    working with technical writers, including how technical writers can be compensated
    for working in open source, and what projects learned about integrating technical
    writers into their communities.</p>'

    created by an entire organisation all by themselves. And that’s without even mentioning
    all the managing upwards, education and outreach to other areas of the organisation,
    and pointless meetings that are also part of everyday life in a modern corporate
    enterprise. Not all of these people will be lone writers forever, though: what
    happens when, sometimes after many months or years of asking politely, nagging,
    or even begging, you get approval to hire another writer? Or even build a whole
    team?</p>

    <p>Going from one lone writer to a team of two, or five, or twenty, brings with
    it a whole host of challenges. Some of them are obvious, like who reports to whom,
    how to get your team talking to each other, how do we organise and apportion work,
    and what collaboration tools should we use. Other challenges you might not expect
    until you encounter them, like how do we make sure that our team is available
    in multiple time zones, and how do make sure we don’t silo knowledge in single
    individuals? </p>

    <p>Lana is currently building out her third documentation team (or fourth, depending

    known as the AT. It took me 163 days. That’s 163 days of carrying everything I
    owned on my back, hiking for 10-12 hours a day, wearing the same clothes every
    day, and eating lots of foods in bar or dehydrated form.</p>

    <p>The AT covers roughly 2100 miles as it crosses 14 states, from Georgia to Maine;
    Virginia is the single longest state, about a quarter of the trail. It has the
    reputation for causing a lot of potential thru-hikers to quit--so much so that
    the state of mind is known as the "Virginia Blues." </p>

    <p>Virginia was the roughest state for me, by far. But using a variety of strategies,
    I was able to stay on trail and successfully complete my thru-hike.</p>

    <p>Our work lives are full of large endurance projects. They can be really exciting,
    like:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Starting a new knowledge base from scratch</li>

    <li>Taking ownership of an existing set of documentation</li>

    <li>Building new curricula or programming</li>

    <li>Building a major new feature</li>

    <li>Hiking a really long trail (okay, maybe not this one)</li>

    </ul>

    <p>In all of these projects, there''s an initial phase of enthusiasm and excitement
    followed by a period of productive work. Then there''s this period in the middle
    where things feel all wrong--we don''t feel like we''re making progress; the project
    feels like it will never end; we feel overwhelmed; and it might even feel totally
    hopeless or outright impossible.</p>

    <p>Somehow, we power through and finish the project. But we don''t talk a lot
    about that rough patch in the middle. Until now.</p>

    <p>This talk is all about that rough patch in the middle. You''ll walk away with
    some actionable strategies you can use to help survive this lull in your next
    big project. And a few random facts about the Appalachian Trail to wow your friends.</p>'

    lunch. </p>

    <p>We have a team of 18 tech writers working on the same project and writing documentation
    for a family of 12 products based on the same platform. And, naturally, we reuse
    a lot of content that covers shared functionality and include it into different
    help instances with filters, conditions, and variables.</p>

    <p>And at some point we began to notice things happening. In this talk, we''ll
    look at things like debugging included content, traffic cannibalisation (doesn''t
    that sound scary?) and how content reuse affects SEO, and other pitfalls of single-sourcing
    that may not be so obvious. Single source is a powerful weapon, but, as with any

    writing is significantly more effective and efficient than traditional siloed
    writing for open source documentation. As we were building the APAC templates
    working group, one of the technical writers suggested a peer-writing approach
    wherein an informal group is formed to collaborate and work together to create
    a quickstart template. Thus began the story of global collaboration between three
    technical writers with diverse backgrounds. Our goal was to plan, explore, analyze,
    create, and publish an exemplary quickstart template.</p>

    <p>Unlike pair programming, peer writing is often viewed with skepticism. We have
    often encountered intriguing questions from the community, such as:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>How can multiple technical writers work together on a single document?</li>

    <li>How did we overcome conflicts without hurting each other?</li>

    <li>How did we create a haven for enthusiastic newbies to quickly contribute?</li>

    <li>How did we create a culture that is non-judgemental and adopt an attitude
    of acceptance, genuineness, and empathy?</li>

    </ul>

    <p>In this talk, on behalf of the working group, I’ll be uncovering our experiences  and
    sharing how in this unique journey we:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Inspired the entire community to adopt this model</li>

    <li>Created judgment-free space to share our ideas</li>

    <li>Helped new tech writers onboard faster into the project</li>

    <li>Applied our combined expertise to create elegant documents </li>

    <li>Encouraged each other to push out of our comfort zone</li>

    <p>At Splunk, we use runbooks to prescribe our response to incidents and to codify
    standard operating procedures. When an incident occurs, the goal is to restore
    operations as quickly as possible. For standard procedures, the goal is to affect
    change with no impact to the customer experience. In either case, the runbook
    must be useful–concise, complete, authoritative, and inclusive of escalation paths
    and other solutions if the first approach doesn’t work. Typical components of
    a Splunk runbook include:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Workflow diagram</li>

    <li>Pre-Checks - Guided investigation; what is the sit-rep?</li>

    <li>Execution</li>

    <li>Post-Checks - How do we prove that the system is back to a healthy state?</li>

    <li>Labels to assist Confluence search, especially including synonyms</li>

    <li>How docs can work with teams to reinforce onboarding, expected behaviors,

    them around, you know that the process can be error-prone and slow. That’s how
    our team used to do docs. Our team is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) group of developers
    and tech writers—specifically, the Integration and Automation team. Our docs are
    guides for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/">AWS reference architectures</a>
    that help people deploy popular technologies in the AWS Cloud.</p>

    <p>In 2020, we switched to a <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/">docs-as-code</a>
    approach, which we dubbed Docs 2.0, using AsciiDoc and GitHub Pages. </p>

    <ul>

    <li>With the use of AsciiDoc, a plain-text authoring format, we streamlined our
    process in several ways: We incorporated documentation into the same CI/CD pipeline
    that we used for code. We built a set of files whose content stayed the same across
    the whole doc set, making that content uneditable so that authors could focus
    on project-specific information. And we created variables and conditions to allow
    for flexibility while improving consistency. </li>

    <li>With GitHub Pages, we automatically generated attractive, navigable docs.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Docs 2.0 has streamlined our process. Developers create content more efficiently
    now that they’re working in a familiar text-based environment. Tech writers no
    longer have to fix formatting or restore the content that no one was supposed
    to touch. Also, docs get updated faster since anyone can submit pull requests.
    Finally, we added translations and spun off various types of guides.</p>

    <p>As successful as Docs 2.0 was, we ran into issues. </p>

    <ul>

    <li>Our docs became hard to manage and learn as variables and conditions proliferated.
    </li>

    <li>Subjecting docs to the same testing as the code created delays and prevented
    technical writers from independently publishing doc edits.</li>

    <li>Keeping common content in every doc made content maintenance unnecessarily
    complex.</li>
