    two underrepresented languages, Tulu and Arebhashe, and the living culture of
    Tulunadu. Both languages are deeply rooted in the rich traditions of Karnataka,
    India, yet they face challenges of recognition and preservation. Through collaborative
    efforts, we have undertaken several projects to safeguard their linguistic and
    cultural heritage. This session will inspire participants to consider the importance

    also facilitates a deeper understanding of complex concepts by allowing readers

    UI elements into reusable components, streamlining the documentation process and
