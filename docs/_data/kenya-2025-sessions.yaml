    <p>In this talk, I will share insights from my extensive work in documenting
    two underrepresented languages, Tulu and Arebhashe, and the living culture of
    Tulunadu. Both languages are deeply rooted in the rich traditions of Karnataka,
    India, yet they face challenges of recognition and preservation. Through collaborative
    efforts, we have undertaken several projects to safeguard their linguistic and
    cultural heritage. This session will inspire participants to consider the importance
    of documenting endangered languages and cultures and the methods required to achieve
    impactful results.</p>

    difficult to navigate. But what if we could make it engaging, intuitive, and even
    enjoyable?
    We'll explore how techniques from storytelling and improvisational theater can
    transform documentation from a mere set of instructions into a compelling user
    experience.
    By borrowing from these creative disciplines, we can craft documentation that
    guides users naturally, anticipates their needs, and adapts dynamically to real-world
    use.
    This talk is designed to inspire, educate, and provide actionable techniques that
    attendees can immediately apply to their documentation projects."

    This session tackles that very frustration starting with PDF/UA, the ISO 14289 standard for accessible PDFs
    and walks you through the practical steps of creating accessible documents.
    We’ll explore real-world workflows: how you produce PDFs from MS Office, LibreOffice, or HTML,
    and why accessibility must start at the source document. You’ll learn how to make source files accessible,
    perform basic validations, and properly export to PDF (never print to PDF!).
    Then, we’ll dig into checking and fixing accessibility using Adobe Acrobat DC and the free PDF Accessibility Checker (PAC 2024).
    We’ll also highlight what can’t be auto-fixed — such as logical reading order and color contrast
    and why manual review still matters.
    The session concludes with a curated list of free and open-source tools,
    plus practical exercises inspired by workshops from NORDIC TechKomm 2017 and tcworld India 2020:
