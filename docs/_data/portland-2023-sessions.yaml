  abstract: '<p>Doing maintenance or updates to existing content can be challenging
    to justify to your organization. There’s even a community who call themselves
    “The Maintainers” who identify as being “interested in the concepts of maintenance,
    infrastructure, repair, and the myriad forms of labor and expertise that sustain
    our human-built world”.</p>

    <p>On our writing team, we had a robust process of evaluating whether, when, and
    how to update our legacy tutorials. We selected tutorials for maintenance in essentially
    two different ways: one (“Tech Debt”) is if we wanted something to link to from
    our newer content, and the other (“Opportunistic”) is metrics-driven.</p>

    <p>In this presentation, we’ll share some of the metrics we used, explain the
    thresholds we used for determining whether to update our older content, and demonstrate
    the measurable results we have from increasing traffic to the content. We used
    several of our own top-of-funnel traffic metrics, comparing against customer conversions
    – our goal was to do maintenance that consistently shows an improvement on all
    of these metrics. You’ll learn how we pitched, scheduled, and edited our own submissions
    to maximize their value to our audience.</p>

    <p>You’ll also learn about the team that authored and edited that content, and
    how we prioritized and undertook that work. From an SEO perspective, this maintenance
    is a great way to improve deep linking across our community site, and from an
    everyday work perspective, it’s a great way to balance the need to always be publishing
    new tutorials with the time to look after what we already have.</p>'

  abstract: '<p>When presenting an API to a customer, that customer''s developers
    depend on accurate and clear API documentation to understand the API contract
    that their code will interact with. How do we make that documentation accurately
    represent behavior, and also look good? How can we handle APIs spread across multiple
    microservices and teams in a company, and make the documentation all look consistent
    instead of looking like none of the teams have ever talked to each other?</p>

    <p>Plenty of tools already exist for developers to write code that documents itself
    and creates its own OpenAPI spec files. However, developer teams do not always
    have the technical writing background needed to adequately describe APIs for customer
    use. Technical writers can make excellent customer-facing documentation, but being
    isolated from development and trying to keep up with field definition changes,
    behavior changes, and various breaking changes, is an onerous task. And how do
    we make it work with legacy code?</p>

    <p>This presentation will show how we are pulling all of this together and creating
    a new process for creating API documentation that we can be proud of. It will
    show how we are creating a partially automatic, partially manual process that
    is fault-tolerant and flexible enough to handle differences in technical approaches,
    customer needs, and personalities.</p>

    <p>What questions will this talk answer?</p>

    <ul>

    <li>How do I make a whole bunch of different services look uniform and coherent?</li>

    <li>How do I create a process for creating OpenAPI spec files that are presentable

    <li>How do I convince people that API documentation is a priority for everyone,
    not just technical writers?</li>

    interview</a>, documentation veteran Pavi Sandhu cited a very reasonable 10:1
    as the ideal ratio of software developers to technical writers, positing that
    a writer can support two scrum teams. However, in case you were wondering why
    you feel busy at work, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, in

    <p>I work at a software company where the developer-to-writer ratio is, conservatively,
    200:1. But this is not a talk about the ideal developer-to-writer ratio. It’s

    a talk about how to grow the team. </p>

    <p>This talk is about how my docs team survives, nay, <em>thrives</em> in an organization

    we made (and continue to make) based on <em>leaning into</em> the huge ratio rather

    <li>Implementing extreme docs-as-code and minimizing maintenance overhead.</li>

    is adherence to rules: document specifications, style guides, and the like. But
    so many of the alleged rules of English come from decades-old myths or the whims
    of long-dead grammarians. How can we, as documentarians, ensure that the rules
    we follow reflect excellent contemporary writing, as determined by both the world
    at large and by our industry-specific language communities?</p>

    <p>My answer to this problem is to constantly apply my training as a descriptive
    linguist to my technical writing practice. I''ll show how to apply basic methods
    of corpus linguistics to quickly answer usage questions, drawing on resources
    as large as the 200 billion words in the Google Books corpus or as small as a
    single Figma file shared among a few teammates. These tools can  quickly reveal
    patterns of existing usage, preventing us from imposing unnatural choices on our
    writing. </p>

    <p>Adopting a descriptive view lets us <strong>document our products the same
    way we talk about our products</strong>, eliminating a translation step that opens
    up the risk of introducing factual errors. Ultimately, building linguistic consensus

    <p>— Kendrick Lamar</p>

    <p>Users visit docs to accomplish a goal. When a product is new, it’s relatively
    simple to construct a good docs experience with a streamlined getting started
    guide and a few concepts. As the product grows more complex, with added features
    and alternative ways of accomplishing similar user goals, the docs swell in volume
    to keep pace. This can lead to poor user experience of a docs site, with users
    being directed to deep, technical guides that don’t answer their simple questions.
    And when docs fail to provide the most important and relevant information to users,
    users get frustrated. </p>

    <p>At Stripe, we’ve developed a simple framework that helps us develop new content
    and assess and revise existing content to create holistically consistent information
    architecture (IA) and an improved user experience. The basic idea is that we should
    think about three main levels of content: orientation, decision, and implementation.
    Each level provides a different type of information that users are likely to need
    at different times. Writers (and other docs contributors) should be aware of these
    levels as they create or reorganize the IA for new products and content. Ideally,
    following this framework ensures that we''ll create an experience where users:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Don''t land on the wrong type of content</li>

    <li>Know where they are in the docs, where to go next, and how to go back if they
    need to</li>

    <li>Accomplish their goal (like complete their Stripe integration successfully)
    while having a surprisingly great experience</li>

    </ul>

    <p>In this presentation, I’ll explain how we developed this framework, compare
    it to other similar frameworks, talk about how we’ve used it in our docs, and
    how others can start using it.</p>'
