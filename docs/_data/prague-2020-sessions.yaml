    I did a lot of teaching, writing, creating video instructions, etc. but I never

    writer I''ve realized that I almost every job that I had has prepared me for this
    career. I have realized that my writing path has started back in high school.</p>

    <p>At the end of my high school education, I had to write a thesis. I''ve written
    77 page manual about a Linux and how to set up the classroom to use it. It was,
    in fact, a manual with a set of instructions for the next generation of students.  At
    that time I was already doing another kind of writing, graffiti writing. As you
    may know, the person that does graffiti is called a writer. There are more similarities
    between creating graffiti and creating technical documentation than you may think.  </p>

    <p>In this talk I would like to show you what have I learned over the years of
    writing, both graffiti and technical writing. Choosing the medium, creating first
    draft, review process, setting the right tone and style that you will use, knowing
    your audience, teamwork, etc. Those are just some of the things that in my opinion
    processes of creating graffiti and technical documentation have in common.</p>'

    <p>Together, we''ll learn that the perfect blend of product and documentation
    creates even more value to your users, teammates, and organization by making your
    content the icing on the cake. Here''s why:

    - Dotting your UI with help content creates an intuitive flow of information for
    your users

    - Baking documentation into your product development process ensures it''s viewed
    as essential to your team''s success

    - Mixing answers to common questions into your app experience helps leaders reduce
    support burden and increase the perceived value of your product</p>

    <p>I''ll share the recipe my team followed to whip up a new app with documentation
    baked in. We''ll walk through steps like:

    1. Pre-measure the ingredients for a rich user information experience

    2. With designers at room temperature, gently fold UI and documentation content
    together

    3. Separate portions of content for reuse and spread within your product and help
    center

    4. Write text for UI and long form documentation together until the experience
    is solid

    5. For extra value, sprinkle marketing content with documentation to taste</p>

    Egypt, was a great leader and innovator of her time, which we’ve all learned about
    through hieroglyphic-laden documentation. She’s also a victim of changes to documentation
    in an effort to erase her contribution to the kingdom’s feats. Luckily for historians,
    edits to stone are hard to conceal!</p>

    <p>Often, the factors that are overlooked when writing project documentation are
    the historical conditions surrounding adoption and advocacy of a particular solution.
    Freshly hired software engineers at Relatively Sized Tech Company may have made
    choices based on the lack of information explaining tech stack history and the
    decision-making that frames it.</p>

    <p>As an Egyptology-Major-turned-Engineering-Leader, I’m surprised by how little
    historical evidence is referenced when it comes to technical decisions, until
    I discovered the main cause: Documented context rarely exists. Oral tradition
    often reigns supreme. As technologists and writers, we should lead the change
    we want to see in robust, well-executed documentation.</p>

    <p>In this talk, I’ll walk through some useful ways to ensure historical context
    is well-documented for your project, and why doing so at the project’s inception
    and throughout its maintenance is particularly important:</p>

    <p>– Learning from archaeology to understand the human activity involved in technical
    projects</p>

    <p>– When and how to document this activity, including decisions, discussions,
    and defeat</p>

    <p>– Why timing matters and how changes after-the-fact can be harmful for future
    users and contributors</p>

    <p>By applying an archaeological mindset to documentation, we can avoid the frustration
    that a lack of historical context affords, particularly when a team member leaves
    or a new pharaoh begins their reign. Let us all be diligent archaeologists and
    make the excavation of documentation a breeze for those who come after us.</p>'

    a master’s degree. Once I started to explore, I found connections everywhere.
    Interestingly, pattern languages provide a unifying link between all my careers.

    Pattern languages have had a transformative effect on numerous domains: built
    architecture, information architecture, software design patterns, wikis, Scrum

    remain surprisingly hidden.

    docs - enabling customers to understand a product feature quickly and painlessly
    - but how do you keep those videos (and other visuals) current when your UI changes
    frequently? ... by making your process modular, measured, detailed, and elastic.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Modular: When you save editable pieces of your videos and GIFs (your assets),
    they can take minutes to update, not hours. We''ll go over the pieces of the files
    that you want to keep separately, and how to utilize those pieces to update an
    asset quickly.</li>

    <li>Measured: How many screenshots of your app can one staff member update in
    one hour? How many screenshots do you have? How many are affected by next month''s
    feature release? Knowing these numbers, tracking them over time, and having them
    available to report to senior leadership means that you can know exactly how much
    staffing you need to be ready for a UI update.</li>

    <li>Detailed: Meticulously record every detail of how you create your visuals.
    How do you decide how much of the app to include? What colors will you use? How
    does your intended audience affect your tone, pacing, and use of annotations?
    Having this all recorded will help others replicate your work.</li>

    <li>Elastic: You don''t need 10 visual experts sitting around twiddling their
    thumbs waiting for an update, just so you''ll be able to deploy them quickly for
    a UI change. But you also don''t want 3 documentarians working around-the-clock

    team. We''ll go over how to achieve this on your team.</li>

    just described the systems that we were documenting. Sometimes, we got adventurous
    and  wrote laundry lists of procedures. These early practices led to the phrase
    RTFM (Read the F____ Manual), because NO ONE ever didl, even if the answer was
    there. We didn’t think much about what our customers wanted or the user stories
    that they live by. </p>

    <p>But any folklorist or linguist can tell you that narrative is the basic structure
    of reality--whether those stories are fairy tales, Biblical parables, or the instructions
    that teach a systems administrator how to install a virtual machine. </p>

    <p>In the 1800s folktale collectors tramped across Europe, Asia, and the United
    States recording the stories that people told around the fire and in their homes.
    These early folklorists quickly discovered that these stories follow set structures
    and have archetypal characters. </p>

    <p>Technical documentation also has fixed structures and archetypal characters.
    But instead of talking about scullery maids and third sons, technical writers
    compose stories where the heroes are customers, developers, and systems administrators.

    <p>The Russian folklorist Vladimir Propp decomposed all of Russian folktales into
    31 “narratemes” or story elements. Similarly at Red Hat, we divided all of our
    documentation into two role-based life cycles: one for developers and one for
    administrators, with fixed tasks for each role. Sure, there are still a few tasks
    and concepts that can fall outside these standard structures, just like there
    are some fairy tales that are unique. But the vast majority of our user stories
    and epics fit within these narratemes.</p>

    <p>In this talk I’ll introduce the audience to tale types and folktale motifs
    and show how similar these are to Red Hat’s standard life-cycle components. I’ll
    show diagrams that content strategists created at Red Hat to show product life
    cycles and real examples of content that fits within these standard categories.
    I’ll help you listen and find the story of the people for whom you’re writing.</p>

    <p>So that we may all live happily ever after.</p>'
