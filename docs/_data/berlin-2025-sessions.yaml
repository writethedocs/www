    we weren’t sure what would come of it. We were focused on software documentation,
    and they were focused on training hotel staff to utilize that software. But what
    we discovered was a shared goal: activating product knowledge to help people work
    better, faster, and with more confidence.</p>

    <p>We began to treat education as a content layer: not separate from product documentation
    but as a powerful complement to it. This shift opened up new ways to collaborate
    on onboarding, feature launches, and help content. We aligned our approaches to
    learning outcomes, audience segmentation, and feedback loops, using documentation
    as a foundation for scalable learning experiences.</p>

    <p>In this talk, I’ll share how we broke down silos between documentation and
    education to create a content ecosystem that drives product adoption across a
    global user base.</p>

    <p>Takeaways:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>How to align documentation and education to serve different learner needs</li>

    <li>How to map documentation to learning outcomes and product goals</li>

    <li>How to build shared workflows that scale knowledge across borders and teams</li>

    <li>Why documentation teams should see themselves as educators</li>

    </ul>

    <p>By connecting documentation and education, we moved from “how it works” to
    “how to use it well,” turning knowledge into activation.</p>'

    ranges of software platforms, our organisation ended up with a fragmented documentation
    landscape. It''s a situation that might be familiar to many: our docs were spread
    across various systems, websites, departments, companies, and formats.</p>

    <p>The main issue was one of discoverability. The documentation was scattered
    and unorganised, and our users struggled to find the information they needed,
    when they needed it. At times they were unaware if it even existed. In addition,
    each piece of documentation followed its own conventions, had different levels
    of detail, or was organised in a unique way, making it hard to navigate or understand
    as a whole. Some product documentation was covered only by FAQs, while other software
    platforms had more detailed user guides. In other cases, we were sending out PDFs
    generated from Word docs and API documentation was scattered across different
    websites and used different tooling. Compounding these issues, our documentation
    teams themselves were geographically dispersed, each operating with different
    practices.</p>

    challenge of keeping documentation current and accurate. The manual process of
    tracking which documents needed updates, assigning them to team members and reminding
    them to update documentation for their respective product categories often felt
    like an uphill battle, consuming valuable time and resources.</p>

    <p>In the fast-paced world of agile development, documentation can quickly become

    maintenance into our daily agile workflow and foster a sense of shared and continued
    ownership.</p>

    <p>In this session, learn how I tackled this problem head-on by designing and
    implementing a robust automated workflow linked directly to our sprint board by
    leveraging our existing tools; this transformed how our team approached documentation
    maintenance. What was once a burdensome manual process is now a streamlined, automated

  abstract: '<p>A portable documentation publishing approach is particularly relevant
    right now because many organizations in Europe are interested in regaining their
    digital sovereignty by transitioning away from technology solutions developed
    and delivered outside of the EU. Our approach to portability does not fundamentally
    rely on closed proprietary technologies or cloud platforms, although we used our
    preferred tools to implement our solution. </p>

    <p>We had a documentation publishing problem that a simple static site could not
    solve. The platform we were creating for our customer consisted of multiple independent
    components and was required to operate on a variety of cloud solutions, as well
    as on-premises in air-gapped facilities. We also didn''t want activities related
    to documentation to muddy the commit histories of our component repositories.</p>

    <p>Our team solved these issues by approaching our documentation in the same way
    as we did the rest of our platform: we delivered it as an independent containerized
    component that we could deploy to all of our platforms in the same way as any
    other application. </p>

    <p>This talk is not a tutorial. It explains key concepts and provides an illustration
    of how we applied a containerization approach to meet our needs.</p>'

    the history of techcomm in the United States, to talk more about international
    communities and organizations, the changing-but-maybe-not-so-different contexts
    within which technical writers work, and how Write the Docs in particular has
    developed over time.</p>

    <p>The 2015 talk ultimately focused on individuals, their stories and a little
    of the institutional background against which their stories developed. This year
    I want to talk about communities: </p>

    <ul>

    <li>how the Write the Docs communities (plural!) have emerged and changed over
    the past ten years</li>

    <li>how other communities have shifted (techwr-l, ) or disbanded (Society for
    Technical Communication), or expanded (tekom)</li>

    </ul>

    <p>There''s a lot of overlap in interest and membership across all these examples
    (and others I''ve missed), but they are or have been organized differently and
    for different purposes. Techwr-l was modelled on old usenet groups (I''d say more
    about what this means), while the much older STC and the much newer tekom both
    follow the professional association model, which itself is considerably older
    still.</p>

    <p>Write the Docs began and continues less formally, but has come to serve many
    of the same needs for its members. What are the differences and similarities,
    and how might considering change over time in all these communities help us to

    <p>At Kong, our team of six writers and one docs tooling engineer supports 12

    of a year, we completely rebuilt our approach to documentation, including how-tos.
    We focused on how users actually interact with docs, copy/pasting down the page,
    and rewrote our content to match that behavior. Now, instead of broken, frustrating
    guides, our how-tos reflect real-world tasks—and we’ll show you how to do the

    a marketing background in tech startups, I never expected to find myself explaining
    time synchronization protocols or memory-safe system utilities to policy analysts

    <p>Over the past two years, I''ve had to rapidly develop a writing style that
    serves a dual purpose: transparency about public investments and advocacy for
    digital infrastructure that most people don''t even know exists. This isn''t traditional
    technical documentation—it''s public accountability and infrastructure advocacy.
    Working with maintainers of dozens of open source projects, I''ve learned to navigate
    the delicate balance between preserving technical accuracy and making content
    comprehensible to policymakers, journalists, and concerned citizens who need to
    understand what their tax money is funding.</p>

    <p>This process involves coordinating with distributed open source communities,
    reviewing internal technical assessments, and crafting narratives that explain
    why we chose to invest in a “memory-safe replacement for GNU coreutils” and what
    that investment will accomplish—without losing the technical nuance that developers
    and security experts need to evaluate our work. But our mission goes beyond funding:
    we''re advocates for making digital infrastructure visible and valued.</p>

  abstract: '<p>One question has been haunting me for years: why do computers persistently
    mislead even highly competent people about their characteristics and capabilities?
    web3, digital twins, autonomous robots, LLMs, metaverse, augmented reality—all
    are mired in interpretations, expectations, and applications almost completely
    divorced from their material reality.</p>

    <p>One possible answer lies in an idea from early 90s HCI research: <em>computers
    as theatre</em>. Since a computer is essentially a black box, every interaction
    is bound to happen in a representational, metaphorical realm—just like a theatrical
    performance. In theatre, both audience and actors suspend their disbelief for
    the duration of the performance, and immerse themselves in the illusions created
    on stage in order to change something about their relationship to the world. Similarly,
    computer users engage with the imaginary worlds of computers to achieve real-world
    effects. They “move a file in the trash” by “pressing a button”, while actually
    doing neither, and yet it has real consequences. Problems ensue when the illusion
    persists even though the performance has ended, or the program has been shut down.</p>

    <p>This poses an interesting challenge to technical communicators. How do you
    write truthfully about products that are pure representation? Should you embrace
    the illusion, and to what extend? How do you maintain the link to reality? How
    do you prevent your metaphors and narratives from escaping confinement? How do
    you shut down the performance?</p>

    <p>In this talk, I want to tackle this challenge by answering three questions:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>What does it mean for software documentation, when we see computers as theatre?</li>

    <li>How does this perspective turn video games like “Pokémon” into great case
    studies for understanding software documentation?</li>

    <li>Why should you read and watch Brecht to learn about truthful technical communication?</li>
