 - abstract: "<p>Most industries have had what we might call an oh-no moment.
    It's those moments that encourage industries to become better regulated,
    in order to prevent further disasters. The IT industry has had many moments
    that could be considered consequential enough to encourage better regulation,
    but the changes have never been made. Because the industry has avoided
    effective regulation for so long, it is possible that we are hurtling
    towards a disaster of epic proportions, one that we haven't even managed
    to conceive of yet.</p>\n

    <p>In this talk, I will go through some historical examples of disasters
    leading to regulation in other industries, and the measures that were put
    into place to mitigate the problem. I will also address some of the major
    moments from the IT industry that should have prompted regulation, and
    haven't. Finally, I will discuss ways that documentation professionals
    are uniquely placed to identify, and potentially blow the whistle on,
    potential disasters before they happen.</p>"

    documentation that can be within reach to individuals who might not
    have ever thought they would be writing code before and why accessible
    documentation needs to be a part of the conversation around diversity
    and inclusion.</p>\n

    <p>We’ll get started by defining what accessible documentation looks like.
    We’ll also cover what common pitfalls exist and how to prevent falling
    into these traps such as talking in jargon and assuming a base of experience
    that isn’t defined.  We will also dig into code examples in documentation
    and discuss what context is needed to ensure that these are reachable to all.
    This talk will conclude with a checklist of what you need to make your
    documentation accessible to all.</p>\n"

- abstract: "<p>When we choose to manage docs like code, we gain a variety
    of options for where to store the “source” files of those docs, and how
    they interact with the code they document. The question then becomes, how
    do we choose among these options? Do we store docs in the code, near the
    code, or in a separate location altogether? What are the implications of
    these choices, for the docs themselves and for the people who maintain
    them?</p>\n

    <p>Open source projects provide a great source for guidance on these questions,
    because their docs, their code, and the evolution of the processes used to
    create both are open for public viewing. As a documentarian working on a
    number of open source projects, as well as providing site deployment support
    to even more, I’ve seen and tried a variety of strategies, and learned from
    both successes and failures.</p>\n

    <p>I’ll cover the benefits and challenges of different approaches, give
    examples of specific projects using each approach, and detail the docs
    evolution of a single open source project, Netlify CMS, as we moved
    through different strategies to meet changing needs and unexpected
    challenges. You’ll leave with guidelines for choosing the best “path”
    for your current and future docs-as-code projects, along with exemplars
    to consult for guidance when you make your choice.</p>"

    no less. That's a horse of a different color!</p>\n

    <p>This talk will briefly touch on toolchains and workflows that peaked
    when we were still delivering help with software, and extrapolate how
    we can use modern code practices and deployment styles to replicate
    the best parts. These will include universal variables, tying
    documentation delivery to the version of the product provided, and
    allowing users to select what they want help with.</p>"

- abstract: "<p>Free and Open Source projects are notorious for
    incomplete and poorly written documentation.</p>\n

    <p><a href=\"http://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/\">GitHub's
    2017 Open Source Survey</a> found that \"documentation is
    highly valued, but often overlooked\" with 93% of respondents
    agreeing that \"incomplete or outdated documentation is a
    pervasive problem.\"</p>\n

    <p>In attempt to solve that problem, many free and open source
    software projects try to make doc writing easier, quicker, and
    less formal — using wikis, lightweight site generators, and
    Markdown. Some people claim that this enables \"non coders\"
    (that is, people who aren't familiar with command lines and
    version control systems) to contribute.</p>\n

    <p>This is a mistake.</p>\n

    <p>Any project larger than a small utility library needs <i>real</i>
    documentation tools. \"Quick\" and \"easy\" tools like wikis and
    Jekyll blogs contribute to documentation debt as organizing,
    editing, and adding content slowly become more onerous and
    disconnected from the developer experience.</p>\n

    <p>The solution is <i>Docs like Code</i> — treating your documentation
    like a first class product, an engineering product. By not ignoring
    the lessons we've learned about how communities write, test, and
    deploy code together, we can get better at writing, testing, and
    deploying documentation together.</p>\n

    <p>Additionally, far from scaring off \"non-coders\", this approach
    encourages potential contributors to learn basic open source
    contribution skills in a less complicated, easier to understand
    context. Since documentation isn't actually code, a Docs as Code
    process provides a relatively low barrier for people to learn and
    practice all the non-coding skills needed for open source
    participation.</p>\n

    <p>Highlighting the documentation process at
    <a href=\"http://docs.opendatakit.org\">Open Data Kit</a>, and
    featuring ideas from several other open source documentation
    projects, this talk will explore how using the common tools,
    processes, and platforms of modern open source development —
    git, GitHub, automated testing, continuous integration —
    fosters the production of high quality documentation and
    empowers new open source contributors.</p>"

- abstract: "<p>In May 2018, the Kubernetes special interest group
    for documentation (SIG Docs) migrated the Kubernetes website's
    static site generator from Jekyll to Hugo. Three of SIG Docs'
    fifteen core maintainers made a proposal that affected
    thousands of contributors to the Kubernetes project.</p>\n

    <p>Starting from an initial conversation in late February,
    2018, the core group of SIG Docs maintainers debated if
    migrating was the right move, came to consensus, created
    a doc assessment for the site, communicated the impact of
    the migration to other Kubernetes stakeholders, migrated
    the site to its new infrastructure, and did post-migration
    cleanup. From proposal to execution, the process took
    three months.</p>\n

    <p>The focus of this talk is on effective decision making
    in large scale, open source projects. We’ll discuss:</p>\n
    <ul>\n
    <li>Why SIG Docs decided to migrate the site's infrastructure</li>\n
    <li>How we propose and discuss large-scale projects</li>\n
    <li>How we communicate as a team</li>\n
    <li>How we get to consensus as a group, and what consensus means to us</li>\n
    <li>How we informed the larger organization</li>\n
    <li>How we decided when to migrate</li>\n
    <li>How we communicated what we did</li>\n
    <li>What the migration experience was like</li>\n
    <li>What went well, and what we wish had gone better</li>\n
    <li>Where we're headed next</li>\n
    </ul>\n

    <p>Along the way, we'll discuss some technical specifics of
    Jekyll and Hugo. We'll also talk about how to get things done
    when mistakes carry seven-figure price tags.</p>\n

    <p>Kubernetes is an open-source software project for orchestrating
    container deployment. For more information, visit

- abstract: "<p>As an engineer dedicated to improving the safety of
    autonomous vehicles, I am beholden to the automotive industry’s
    standard used for certifying functional safety for EE systems —
    ISO 26262. The purpose of this standard is to minimize the risk
    of harm by enforcing a structured, rigorous product development
    process. This means that before a component can be integrated
    into a vehicle, it must be certified as compliant with the
    aforementioned standard.</p>\n

    <p>Complying with ISO 26262 is a meticulous and arduous process,
    by design. To satisfy this traditionally bureaucratic behemoth,
    extensive amounts of very specific documentation must be furnished
    as evidence that the requirements of the standard were strictly
    adhered to. The scope and purpose of this evidence vastly exceeds
    that of the documentation done in a typical software development
    process. To maintain efficiency and flexibility while developing
    our software, we knew we’d need to lean into automation to grapple
    with this beast.. Our goals are specific to automotive, but we
    predicted the resulting tools and processes would be valuable to
    providing consistency and verifiability to any project. One facet
    of facilitating this goal that we’ve pursued---and is covered by
    this talk---is a specification for constraining Markdown document
    structure and a tool created for validating it.</p>"
