- abstract: "<p>Most industries have had what we might call an oh-no moment.
    It's those moments that encourage industries to become better regulated,
    in order to prevent further disasters. The IT industry has had many moments
    that could be considered consequential enough to encourage better regulation,
    but the changes have never been made. Because the industry has avoided
    effective regulation for so long, it is possible that we are hurtling
    towards a disaster of epic proportions, one that we haven't even managed
    to conceive of yet.</p>\n

    <p>In this talk, I will go through some historical examples of disasters
    leading to regulation in other industries, and the measures that were put
    into place to mitigate the problem. I will also address some of the major
    moments from the IT industry that should have prompted regulation, and
    haven't. Finally, I will discuss ways that documentation professionals
    are uniquely placed to identify, and potentially blow the whistle on,
    potential disasters before they happen.</p>"

- abstract: "<p>The most common perception around the term UX writing is that it
    only includes microcopy for the user interfaces. However, that is not
    correct. Writing snappy messages on the UI is only a part of it; more
    important aspect is developing a voice for the product and imbibing that
    voice in your content (UX, help, knowledge base, etc).</p>\n

    <p>This talk covers some of the necessary skills required for being good at
    UX writing and how these skills help us in designing a better product
    experience. Whether be it the decision of keeping the tone professional
    vs casual or using title case vs sentence case, decisions must be taken
    based on the audience and should always be in-context.</p>\n

    <p>And yea, one last thing, technical writers are/can be great UX writers!</p>"

   too many questions and not enough answers, and so much assumed knowledge
   about the company you joined and the products they make.</p>\n

   <p>I’m going to talk about how you can make those first few weeks your most
   productive and valuable to your new company. By writing internal
   documentation that answers all the questions only someone new on the block
   knows to ask, you can help pave the way for new hires in the future, and
   even help identify and solve customer pain points.</p>\n

   <p>Drawing from my own experiences working as an intern and support agent
   among highly technical teams, I will go over deciding what to document
   based on the level of technical proficiency you would expect the reader to
   have, how to use tone to convey the company’s spirit and keep a future
   reader interested, and how to future-proof your internal documentation so
   it doesn’t stop being updated when you move on.</p>"

- abstract: "<p>Code review is the duty of every developer in a team. We are
    the guards of the mystical “good” code and defenders against evil technical
    debt. It’s universally agreed that it’s easy to spot “bad” code and much
    harder to determine “good” code.</p>\n

    <p>I’m going to share some of my experiences working on a team producing
    a large amount of code every day, with few reviewers. We’ll dive into
    looking for smart architectural and design decisions, coherently
    understanding what problem the author intended to solve and understanding
    how they implemented a solution.</p>\n

    <p>I’ll touch on automating away the most common issues within Code Review
    and pulling the technical brains out of your team mates into great
    documentation. Most importantly we’ll talk about the human side of code
    review and how to manage code review within large and small teams. Code
    review helps our teams grow institutional knowledge and shared understanding
    of the systems we build together. A strong understanding of how to review
    code will help you to write better code and help you help your teammates
    to write better code.</p>"
