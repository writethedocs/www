    collections. Museums I worked with managed tens of thousands of items. Every item
    has a database record containing every scrap of information known. Museum staff
    have to care for the physical item and its digital counterpart. Despite this massive
    responsibility, museums suffer from a lack of resources, staff, and time. Sound
    familiar?</p>

    <p>When I start as a technical writer - often in a newly established role - I
    try to assess the state of the documentation. While contemplating the mess, I
    find myself transported to another time. Where the mess was discovering another
    storage space filled to the ceiling with objects of all sizes and shapes. Fragile
    lace doilies on engines and delicate glass valves that are probably radioactive.
    And the pièce de résistance? A mannequin lying face down in a puddle of water
    from the latest roof leak. </p>

    <p>My mess has become documentation instead of objects but museums taught me how
    to manage the unmanageable. Surprisingly, there are countless overlaps between
    museums and docs. Some that I want to share include:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Audit/inventory management</li>

    <li>Knowing what to throw away</li>

    <li>Standards and style guides</li>

    <li>Managing historic mistakes or blank spaces</li>

    where it emerged as a solution to address language, communication, and documentation
    challenges. While it initially served the defence sector, STE’s inherent versatility
    and adaptability have made it remarkably relevant and applicable to various industries.
    This workshop explores the evolution of STE from an aerospace standard to its
    potential in revolutionising documentation practices in the software industry.
    By embracing STE, participants will gain insights into how this linguistic paradigm
    shift can help organisations across diverse sectors enhance clarity, efficiency,
    and comprehension in their software-related communication.</p>

    development and the end product. Unfortunately accessibility is often an afterthought
    in design processes, and a lack of clear and effective documentation can be a
    contributing factor. </p>

    <p>Our team supports learning and teaching staff at a university with a repository
    of resources and blog posts (which are also publicly available), and accessibility
    is an area of focus for us. In higher education, inaccessible content can have
    profoundly negative effects for students, ranging from poor learning experiences
    to increased rates of non-completion for students with disabilities. </p>

    <p>Our approach to creating documentation for accessibility brings together learning
    and teaching practitioners, content designers and students with lived experience
    of disability to encourage empathetic practice of accessibility principles. We
    combine clear instructive content, real-life examples and student-created content
    to emphasise the benefits of accessible practice for all students and the impacts
    of inaccessibility. While our context is in higher education, this approach can
    be applied in many different fields and scenarios that require documentation.
    </p>

    <p>This talk will cover: </p>

    <ul>

    <li>Our co-design process with students, and including people with lived experience</li>

    <li>Using a range of content types to educate about accessibility (including articles,
    supportive and instructional documentation, and video)</li>

    <li>Helping users connect their accessibility practice with real world outcomes</li>

    <li>Writing guidelines that are easy to follow for those who are new to accessibility</li>

    <li>Encouraging accessibility compliance as best practice to benefit all users</li>

    <li>Inclusive and empathetic communication for different projects and contexts</li>

    required to write technical documentation. Engineers are often required to write
    the first draft document which may or may not be refined in a subsequent review
    by a technical writer. Part of the lack of importance given to writing documentation
    by some engineers may be due to them feeling uncomfortable about writing. Some
    engineers may have had negative experiences with writing in the past. In some
    cases, their negative perception of themselves as a writer can impact their performance
    when writing technical documentation. </p>

    <p>The workplace can be conceived as a learning environment. This learning environment
    needs to help people of all abilities to succeed and needs to recognise that negative
    self-perception and negative prior experiences can be a significant impediment
    to success. Drawing on research from the adult-education sector and other sources,
    I will explore how we can adopt a ‘growth-mindset’ view of ourselves and our co-workers
    instead of seeing people as having deficits in abilities. On this foundation,
    I will then open a conversation about what practical steps, aside from formal
    training, can be implemented in the workplace to help everyone feel that they
    can succeed as writers.</p>'

    Tech Writer at early-stage start-ups: my job is not to describe your product,
    my job is to help users become successful and confident using your software. And
    yet, my nearly 20-year career in tech writing and management has focused almost
    entirely on requirements that demand product-centric documentation that exhaustively
    explains the parts, but fails to prescribe how to use the whole.</p>

    <p>After countless doc plans and earnest entreaties to approach new documentation
    projects from a user''s task-based perspective, I finally found myself with an
    opportunity to write content that answers questions and solves problems. I''d
    like to tell the story of how I refactored a complete set of software documentation
    from "bland" to "much better" in a docs-as-code environment in which I focused
    squarely on what the users need to know, not on what a company wants to say about
    their products.</p>

    <p>I''ll describe how I managed to coax my product management and engineering
    colleagues into reimagining the documentation, how I organized the practical steps
    to incrementally implement the changes, and I''ll discuss the early feedback from
    users about their experience with a different kind of documentation.</p>'

  abstract: '<p>When it comes to quantifying the "success" of documentation, trying
    to use metrics to figure out if your docs are actually helping people can be a
    daunting and frustrating task. Most analytics tools were built primarily with
    marketers and product managers in mind, and sorting through the near-infinite
    analytics features has lead many a documentarian to spend too much time tuned
    into metrics that don''t result in any tangible docs improvements.</p>

    <p>In this talk, I''ll share my insights into which metrics can provide the most
    value for you as a docs writer based on my 4+ years leading the docs team at a
    product analytics software company. Through lots of trial, error, and writing
    meta-docs about analytics while grappling with them myself, I managed to suss
    out several metrics which consistently resulted in tangible docs improvements
    that made us (and our readers) happier.</p>

    <p>By the end of this talk, you''ll have a handy list of metrics which may prove
    beneficial  for your team, and a strengthened intuition for when a metric is simply
    noise to tune out - and what may be worth tuning into.</p>'
