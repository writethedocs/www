    is important, and we also know that the style and layout of our pages matters.
    The third leg of the stool is information architecture: getting the right content,
    in the right place, at the right time. Great information architecture not only
    helps readers navigate our docs properly, but also influences whether they have
    a good or bad experience, helps them feel good about your company or product,
    and can even help them to find information they didn''t know they were looking
    for. Additionally, good information architecture can help you improve your SEO,
    improve dwell time on your site, and reduce bounce rates. In this talk, Lana will
    discuss how to assess your current information architecture, work out what information
    architecture your docs require, and how to implement it for the best results.
    Whether you are working with an aging docs suite, or starting fresh, if you can
    choose the right words, this talk will help you work out where to put them.</p>'

  abstract: '<p>The work of a tech writer requires skills, knowledge, and a love of
    technology combined with constant learning, which is very similar to a developer
    job. But unlike developers, we, as writers, often hit the career wall while working
    in the same position, for a single employer, on the same tasks, using the same
    tools, release after release. </p>

    <p>Often, we hit a glass ceiling in terms of salary, too, as there is nothing
    new that we could bring to the table while toiling away on the same things, with
    no practical experience with other tools and approaches. Even with a dream employer,
    repetitiveness leads to fatigue, hopelessness, and burnout. </p>

    <p>This talk is about changing the mindset from only working for a single employer
    to successful freelance side-hustling for the sake of growing one''s expertise
    deeper. It is about becoming a T-shaped tech writer by turning to freelancing
    in various forms, from consulting to writing, editing, managerial and strategic
    work. </p>

    <p>The talk covers:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>ethical side of side-hustling</li>

    <li>legal side (contract agreements, non-compete clauses, NDAs)</li>

    <li>financial side (invoicing, payment systems, budgeting, taxes)</li>

    <li>effective time-management (scheduling, working with distributed teams, dealing
    with scarce communication)</li>

    <li>self-care (optimal work and rest times, setting boundaries, routines &amp;
    rituals)</li>

    <li>specific tools for dealing with all the points provided above </li>

    are uniquely suited to assist technical teams in doing API design, especially
    when an API First design approach is being followed. </p>

    <p>When documenting a web API, technical writers may end up identifying areas
    of improvement in the way it''s designed. Much like it happens with user documentation
    for user interfaces, there''s a big opportunity for making your voice be heard
    upstream, where APIs are designed and implemented. It takes time, and the right
    processes, but the end result is better documentation, too.</p>

    <p>In this talk I''ll tell you how I began my API design journey at Ohpen and
    the kind of processes we put in place to align API design across teams, including
    an API design style guide that covered error messages, content reuse, and naming
    conventions, among other things. Along the way, I''ll present some of the most
    common obstacles I faced and how I got around them.</p>'

    <p>Working in software development, my technical communications team was no exception,

    past months. However, the team managed to find creative ways to overcome these
    challenges and managed to avoid becoming invisible within the organization (which
    is still a widespread issue for tech comm teams). In fact, we even managed to
    turn less than ideal circumstances around, forging an agile team and stabilizing
    our position within the organization during the process. </p>

    <p>The challenges include difficulties on a personal level, the team’s level,
    and on an organizational level as well. They encompass work-life balance, workflow,

    may be very familiar with those of documentarians in companies.</p>

    <p>A little more than a year and a half ago the research group I''m working in
    asked me to take up "knowledge management". One of the key things that had to
    be addressed was that much of the documentation that we made ended up in somewhere
    in one of our many storage spaces. We had no standardization on what was sored
    where, and some of the locations were only visible to part of our group members.
    Our core business is to develop and share knowledge, so something had to be done!</p>

    <p>In the following year we first set out to find out what we actually wanted
    to share with whom, and what roadblocks we found, both technical and organizational.
    As our organization is trying to be "LEAN", we asked the help of a lean coach to
    look with us what the "root causes" were for the lack of information sharing.
    One of the main things we found out "on the go" is that the documents we had standardized,
    but never made were indeed those that no one was interested in.</p>

    <p>In the process of standardizing and recreating our knowledge products, we had
    a lot of hurdles to take, such as getting consesus what we actually need to document,
    getting some kind of "definition of done" and determining the locations of file
    storage and how to get the right internal and external people the right access.
    In this presentation I can share the process we went through, and give our current
    perspective on how we''re doing now.</p>'

    <p>The focus is on servicing a broad range of users'' psychological states and

    work psychologically):</p>

    <p><strong>Include time frames for resolution</strong> — people in anxiety live
    in a different temporal state than people who are calm, so holding their hand
    in understanding a future state is important for a sense of psychological safety<p></p>

    <p><strong>Be brave about when a given situation is difficult</strong> — frustrated
    people are often in a combative state looking for some way out of that emotional
    state through vindication, and being acknowledged is a way they can help themselves
    regulate</p>

    <p><strong>Highlight the action to be taken (even if that action is "wait")</strong>
    — exhausted people struggling to be engaged or those anxious about what to do
    next need a clear understanding of next steps, and unclear directions will lead
    them astray</p>

    contexts. Most often with English as a shared corporate language. And we’re expected
    to function at a high level of both technical and social proficiency in English.
    </p>

    <p>In my daily work and socializing with colleagues across different disciplines
    and nationalities, I’m frequently reminded of my studies in Business English as
    a Lingua Franca, which I use in a practical sense both when collaborating with
    colleagues and when writing actual documentation. </p>

    <p>This is where applied linguistics comes in, based on this definition, shamelessly
    stolen from Wikipedia: "[applied linguistics] identifies, investigates, and offers
    solutions to language-related real-life problems"</p>

    <p>In short, what I’ve found during my academic studies is:</p>

    <p>•   People don’t speak English. They speak their own language with English
    words.</p>

    <p>•   We cluster together in perceived like-minded groups (example: Italians,
    French and Spanish; Scandinavians)-</p>

    <p>•   Shared contexts are more important than language proficiency-</p>

    <p>In this talk, I’ll give examples of how these findings aren’t just theoretical
    – they’re all around me during my day-to-day in tech. I’ll elaborate on this and
    give some examples of how I use that to improve my collaboration with SMEs and
    my actual writing.</p>'
