    is important, and we also know that the style and layout of our pages matters.
    The third leg of the stool is information architecture: getting the right content,
    in the right place, at the right time. Great information architecture not only
    helps readers navigate our docs properly, but also influences whether they have
    a good or bad experience, helps them feel good about your company or product,
    and can even help them to find information they didn''t know they were looking
    for. Additionally, good information architecture can help you improve your SEO,
    improve dwell time on your site, and reduce bounce rates. In this talk, Lana will
    discuss how to assess your current information architecture, work out what information
    architecture your docs require, and how to implement it for the best results.
    Whether you are working with an aging docs suite, or starting fresh, if you can
    choose the right words, this talk will help you work out where to put them.</p>'

  abstract: '<p>The work of a tech writer requires skills, knowledge, and a love of
    technology combined with constant learning, which is very similar to a developer
    job. But unlike developers, we, as writers, often hit the career wall while working
    in the same position, for a single employer, on the same tasks, using the same
    tools, release after release. </p>

    <p>Often, we hit a glass ceiling in terms of salary, too, as there is nothing
    new that we could bring to the table while toiling away on the same things, with
    no practical experience with other tools and approaches. Even with a dream employer,
    repetitiveness leads to fatigue, hopelessness, and burnout. </p>

    <p>This talk is about changing the mindset from only working for a single employer
    to successful freelance side-hustling for the sake of growing one''s expertise
    deeper. It is about becoming a T-shaped tech writer by turning to freelancing
    in various forms, from consulting to writing, editing, managerial and strategic
    work. </p>

    <p>The talk covers:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>ethical side of side-hustling</li>

    <li>legal side (contract agreements, non-compete clauses, NDAs)</li>

    <li>financial side (invoicing, payment systems, budgeting, taxes)</li>

    <li>effective time-management (scheduling, working with distributed teams, dealing
    with scarce communication)</li>

    <li>self-care (optimal work and rest times, setting boundaries, routines &amp;
    rituals)</li>

    <li>specific tools for dealing with all the points provided above </li>

    that you use to describe your API enable conversations between software and people

    are uniquely suited to assist technical teams in doing API design, especially
    when an API First design approach is being followed. </p>

    <p>When documenting a web API, technical writers may end up identifying areas
    of improvement in the way it''s designed. Much like it happens with user documentation
    for user interfaces, there''s a big opportunity for making your voice be heard
    upstream, where APIs are designed and implemented. It takes time, and the right
    processes, but the end result is better documentation, too.</p>

    <p>In this talk I''ll tell you how I began my API design journey at Ohpen and
    the kind of processes we put in place to align API design across teams, including
    an API design style guide that covered error messages, content reuse, and naming
    conventions, among other things. Along the way, I''ll present some of the most
    common obstacles I faced and how I got around them.</p>'

    that all tech writers are writing for technically savvy users, and that we all
    had access to fancy tools. What do you do when you’re a tech writer for accountants
    and social workers? When your documentation is written in MS Word, and hosted
    on SharePoint? </p>

    <p>I am part of a large base of documentarians who are still using word processing
    programs, and who are writing for people for whom technology is still seen mostly
    as an impediment, not as an asset for their jobs. I am the lead tech writer at
    a property management firm, and my audience is made up of all 600 of our staff,
    from maintenance personnel to the woman in the corner office. Our tools are simple
    ones, because our staff needs explicit directions in a printable PDF, something
    they can mark up and put in a binder on their desk. These are people who, by and
    large, have a semi-antagonistic attitude about technology, from their phones to
    our primary, custom SaaS database, and have a wide, <em>wide</em> variation in
    use cases.</p>

    <p>So when your tools are limited, and your audience is not at all technically
    savvy, how do you organize the documentation upgrade process? I just finished
    a complete reorganization and rewrite of all our manuals, to reflect the government
    mandated changes in the SaaS. What does framing look like, and the style guide,
    when git and docs-as-code aren’t actually options? When 60% of your audience needs
    help changing their password, what are the things that you need to take into account
    as you write your documentation on highly technical processes in the WYSIWYG SaaS
    database? </p>

    <p>A little more than a year and a half ago the research group I''m working in
    asked me to take up "knowledge management". One of the key things that had to
    be addressed was that much of the documentation that we made ended up in somewhere
    in one of our many storage spaces. We had no standardization on what was sored
    where, and some of the locations were only visible to part of our group members.
    Our core business is to develop and share knowledge, so something had to be done!</p>

    <p>In the following year we first set out to find out what we actually wanted
    to share with whom, and what roadblocks we found, both technical and organizational.
    As our organization is trying to be "LEAN", we asked te help of a lean coach to
    look with us what the "root causes" were for the lack of information sharing.
    One of the main things we found out "on the go" is that the documents we had standardized,
    but never made were indeed those that noone was interested in.</p>

    <p>In the process of standardizing and recreating our knowledge products, we had
    a lot of hurdles to take, such as getting consesus what we actually need to document,
    getting some kind of "definition of done" and determining the locations of file
    storage and how to get the right internal and external people the right access.
    In this presentation I can share the process we went through, and give our current
    perspective on how we''re doing now.</p>'

    In my daily work and socializing with colleagues across different disciplines
    and nationalities, I’m frequently reminded of my studies in Business English as
    a Lingua Franca, which I use in a practical sense both when collaborating with
    colleagues and when writing actual documentation. This is where applied linguistics

    when you have to give users bad news—whether in error messages, email comms, or
    support docs.</p>

    <p>The focus is on servicing a broad range of users'' psychological states and
    needs during times of distress and disconnection, primarily anxiety, frustration,
    and exhaustion. Some tips I want to bring up (along with the basics of how they
    work psychologically):</p>

    <p><strong>Include time frames for resolution</strong> — people in anxiety live
    in a different temporal state than people who are calm, so holding their hand
    in understanding a future state is important for a sense of psychological safety<p></p>

    <p><strong>Be brave about when a given situation is difficult</strong> — frustrated
    people are often in a combative state looking for some way out of that emotional
    state through vindication, and being acknowledged is a way they can help themselves
    regulate</p>

    <p><strong>Highlight the action to be taken (even if that action is "wait")</strong>
    — exhausted people struggling to be engaged or those anxious about what to do
    next need a clear understanding of next steps, and unclear directions will lead
    them astray</p>

    <p>While some of these may seem "obvious," my talk is about why they work, and
    the empathy advocacy I want to help spread in the documentarian community.</p>'
