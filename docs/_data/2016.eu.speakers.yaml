- title: Healthy Minds in a Healthy Community
  abstract: "<p>Open source communities attract and boast passionate, idealistic people,
    and many of us invest copious amounts of time and effort to contribute to our
    projects and support our communities. This underlying emotional attachment can
    make us more vulnerable to elevated stress, burnout and conflicts. And then
    there are those of us who also manage mental illness.\nMore often than not,
    we suffer these struggles in silence, feeling (and fearing) that we\u2019re
    alone in our trouble. Here, our communities can make a huge difference, by building
    a positive and safe environment where we can blossom and support ourselves and
    our peers, and feel included.\nThis talk will take a look at open-source communities
    through the eyes of various mental well-being issues and struggles, show various
    things that some communities already do. We will also cover several new initiatives
    from the community around Django, a common open-source web framework for Python,
    to further promote the well-being of our community members. This will hopefully
    inspire more communities to help foster healthy minds in a healthy environment.</p>"

  abstract: '<p>Feedback is a big deal. As tech writers we want to receive adultation
    when the docs rock, or constructive criticism when there is cleanup required.
    Or EVEN BETTER, we want the engineers/community members/reddit readers/clowns

    <p>But. Actually tweaking the signal to noise ratio to something useful is really
    difficult. Especially when you are curating a site as enormous as MDN, the content
    of which is open licensed, multilingual, and open for public editing.</p>

    <p>In this talk, MDN writer Chris Mills discusses topics such as how to choose
    the right feedback mechanism(s) for your situation, how to stem the torrent and
    get the right kind of feedback and contributions (actually useful), effective
    begging, stealing and borrowing, and how to balance being firm and keeping control
    of your product with being diplomatic and being able to sleep at night.</p>'

  abstract: '<p>As documentarians, our primary goal is delivering the content that
    users need in order to use our products. This might sound simple, but we are often
    writing about complex systems, which will be used by people of varying skill levels.
    Our final publications may have all the words in the right order, but sometimes
    our biggest challenge is getting access to the right content in the first place.</p>

    <p>Deciding on what is the right content can often be hard, and extracting it
    from the development team can be even harder. Some of us might be able to read
    the codebase to decipher what information a user will need. Some of us might get
    to sit in planning and strategy meetings to gain a thorough understanding of our
    user and their documentation requirements. Most of us though will find something
    in the middle - we sit with developers and engineers, build relationships, and
    elbow our way into their process. </p>

    <p>This talk will look at several ways in which to mentor your engineering and
    marketing specialists so that everyone in your team can contribute to the documentation
    process. I call this "Documentoring" - its about training the people around you
    to understand the requirements of a documentarian, and to truly value the docs
    as part of the product lifecycle.</p>

    <p>Through my experience at IBM, and then at a small startup in Bristol, I''ve
    seen (and tried) various techniques at getting everyone in your team invested
    in quality documentation. I''ll share stories of my successes and failures, and
    show you how documentation really can be a team effort, even if you stand alone
    in your company as the sole owner of the docs.</p>'

  abstract: "<p>The success of an API crucially depends on how well its documentation
    meets the information needs of software developers. But what information do
    developers need? What information do they want, and what information are they
    actually using when starting to learn a new API and solve programming tasks
    with it?\nIn this talk, I will present the results of some empirical studies
    I conducted with my team to better understand the information needs of software
    developers. One the one hand, we ran more than 20 semi-structured interviews
    with junior and senior developers and asked them \u2013 among other things \u2013
    to tell us about the questions they raise first when approaching a new API,
    the type of documentation they look for, and general expectations and experiences
    regarding API documentation. Key findings derived from the interviews were then
    followed up on by a standardized survey in which more than 110 developers participated.
    Our second study took a different approach. Instead of asking developers what
    they find important about API documentation, we asked them to solve a few tasks
    on a simple (REST)-API that was unfamiliar to them. The goal of this study was
    to observe how the developers approach the tasks and which pieces of the documentation
    provided with the test API they actually use. Besides presenting the design
    and main findings of our studies, I will also discuss implications the results
    may have regarding the contents, structure and design of API documentation.</p>"

    <p>As a beginner (non-native English) content creator, I had hard times during
    my work. Most of the problems came from me because the lack of confidence and
    the lack of practice. To grow faster, I had to build a process (rather a routine)

  abstract: "<p>Writing fiction and writing documentation have much more in common
    that typing out large blocks of text. This talk will talk about elements of
    fiction writing that improve the process of writing docs: Understanding audience:
    the tools fiction writers use to understand their audience (as well as to communicate
    with them) offer deeper looks at who reads what. The process of connecting with
    an audience is integral to fiction, but often overlooked in documentation \u2014
    resulting in hard-to-use docs that don\u2019t help users. Building story arcs:
    arguably, all fiction boils down to about seven different plots, retold in millions
    of different ways. Understanding underlying story structure makes the process
    of writing new tales much easier. Those story structures and plot elements can
    map directly to parts of documentation, as well as show options for creating
    standing elements for documentation. * Writing prose worth reading: documentation
    can be enjoyable to read, provided a writer is willing to invest time in crafting
    good reading material.\nThis talk will draw on examples from both popular fiction
    and documentation out in the world today.</p>"

  abstract: '<p>What are the characteristics of a great documentation set? Completeness?
    Accuracy? Style? Format? No! A great documentation set is one that meets its objectives,
    and sometimes the barrier to greatness is not dedication, skill, or passion, but
    a reluctance to let things go. Every document we publish should reach a certain
    quality threshold - but that threshold varies depending on its audience, the maturity
    of the project, and the overall project goals. What matters is not that docs are
    perfect, but that they are <em>good enough</em>. </p>

    <p>But how to determine if a doc is "good enough"? This talk will cover how to:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Define document quality</li>

    <li>Establish an appropriate quality bar for a document or doc set</li>

    <li>Determine if a document meets that bar.</li>

  abstract: '<p>Treating docs as code, an approach that more and more teams and companies
    are moving toward, involves more than putting the two together in a repo. We discuss
    some of the details that often get lost in as dev and docs learn to work together
    in new ways. Because if all we do is put doc files next to code files in source
    control, or use parts of the same workflow for code and docs, we''re still isolating
    docs as a separate sort of responsibility, free from the obligations of systematic
    review and testing without which code would never be accepted into production.</p>

    <p>Some missing parts of this newer approach to documentation workflow that we''ll
    discuss include:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Outlining a documentation lifecycle that describes how material moves from
    initial draft to final production, to help people unfamiliar with documentation
    development understand better how to efficiently manage documentation review and
    testing.</li>

    <li>Mapping GitHub workflow clearly to documentation workflow. This can help writers
    and editors understand better just how to use GitHub effectively, and equally
    important how it can help other contributors (notably programmers) understand
    the parts of the writer workflow that can be lost when docs move next to code.</li>

    <li>Creating an information architecture. Words need structure to provide meaning,
    usability, and discoverability. A strong content architecture provides logical
    places for adding new content, especially for doc projects at scale.</li>

    <Li>Developing and enforcing a style guide: terminology, voice, tone. These things
    make the difference between words that users might understand, and documentation
    that can truly assist.</li>

    <li>Reviewing and line/copy editing. Because you wouldn''t do any less for code,
