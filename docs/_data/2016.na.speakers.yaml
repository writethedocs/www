    \ source software projects built by other agencies, since agencies often have\
    \ similar technology problems to solve? And what if they hired technical writers\
    \ with open source community experience to write documentation for these projects?\
    \ That would be pretty cool. Also, that\u2019s my work. I'm part of 18F, a digital\
    \ services consulting team within and for the federal government, and all of our\
    \ work is open source.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll explain surprising and rewarding aspects\
    \ of working on documentation in government, through the lens of the cross-agency\
    \ <a href=\"https://eregs.github.io/\">eRegulations</a> project I\u2019ve been\
    \ working on. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau started it, our 18F team\
    \ (in the General Services Administration) adapted it for the Bureau of Alcohol,\
    \ Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and we\u2019re adapting it for use by two\
    \ more agencies.</p>\n<p>I believe open source software development with good\
    \ documentation aligns with core values of our government: work by the government\
    \ belongs to the people, so it should be as transparent as possible, open to input\
    \ from the people, and reusable by the people. The implementation of those values\
    \ is the complicated part, of course! I\u2019ll explain how we get stuff done\
    \ at both the big-picture level (how laws and government economics shape our work)\
    \ and the day-to-day details (how we work across teams to get useful information\

- abstract: "<p>Writing fiction and writing documentation have much more in common\
    \ that typing out large blocks of text. This talk will talk about elements of\
    \ fiction writing that improve the process of writing docs:\n<em> Understanding\
    \ audience: the tools fiction writers use to understand their audience (as well\
    \ as to communicate with them) offer deeper looks at who reads what. The process\
    \ of connecting with an audience is integral to fiction, but often overlooked\
    \ in documentation \u2014 resulting in hard-to-use docs that don\u2019t help users.\n\
    \ </em> Building story arcs: arguably, all fiction boils down to about seven different\
    \ plots, retold in millions of different ways. Understanding underlying story\
    \ structure makes the process of writing new tales much easier. Those story structures\
    \ and plot elements can map directly to parts of documentation, as well as show\
    \ options for creating standing elements for documentation.\n* Writing prose worth\
    \ reading: documentation can be enjoyable to read, provided a writer is willing\
    \ to invest time in crafting good reading material.</p>\n<p>This talk will draw\
    \ on examples from both popular fiction and documentation out in the world today.</p>"

  title: What Writing Fiction Teaches You About Writing Documentation
  year: '2016'
  youtubeId: UI9yD3_wgho
- abstract: "<p>As a tech writer, you care about two things: knowing your audience\
    \ and delivering the most concise information possible to that audience. But how\
    \ do you do that when your audience is incredibly specialized? What if the information\
    \ you\u2019re presenting is rapidly changing? How can you be certain that your\
    \ documentation is always relevant for that audience?</p>\n<p>To answer all those\
    \ questions, at New Relic we use CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) data. Our Docs team\
    \ monitors CSAT comments and data for every single public-facing doc we own. We\
    \ use that data to make dynamic decisions that affect our site and our docs work,\
    \ influencing everything from quick doc fixes, giant rewrites, and our own site\u2019\
    \ s functionality.</p>\n<p>Every pertinent comment receives attention from at\
    \ least one tech writer. Part of our code example is out of date? Fixed. There\u2019\
    \ s a glitch on our site? We\u2019ll look into it. We list a version of Mongo\
    \ that\u2019 s outdated? Updated. By focusing on these comments, your audience\
    \ is working with you to keep your documentation updated. </p>\n<p>What happens\
    \ when a customer doesn\u2019t leave a comment, and just says the document wasn\u2019\
    t helpful? We track that too. When docs have consistently negative feedback without\
    \ constructive comments, we know that at least something in that doc needs work.\
    \ When that happens, we work with SMEs to rewrite those docs and give them a little\
    \ love. We polish \u2018em up and publish them again, tracking their data afterwards\
    \ to make sure that they\u2019re indeed improved.  </p>\n<p>And this doesn\u2019\
    \ t just benefit the Docs team. We\u2019ve forwarded UI complaints to design,\
    \ and disgruntled customer comments to Support. That\u2019s part of the beauty\
    \ of CSAT: it\u2019s a direct line to all the customers looking for help with\
    \ our products. With CSAT, our audience is helping us to curate the best possible\
    \ information for all their needs.</p>\n<p>But we\u2019re not stopping there.\
    \ Soon, we\u2019ll be implementing OAuth for our CSAT data. Once that\u2019s enabled,\
    \ we\u2019ll be able to see what specific products customers are using, what region\
    \ they\u2019re in, what type of user permissions they have, and a ton of other\
    \ stuff. We\u2019ll be positively swimming in audience connectedness from our\
    \ CSAT, and with it, we\u2019ll know that our audience is understanding our concise\
    \ information in the best way possible. </p>"

- abstract: "<p>Documentation for most web applications today still follows the cognitive\
    \ model of the good old fashioned documentation manual: While there might be some\

    \ as a separate object that is except for a few deep links on particularly troublesome\
    \ areas, only accessible through a top domain.</p>\n<p>But it doesn\u2019t have\
    \ to be this way, we should be perfectly able to predict what help resources a\

    \ they can loose their context while searching for answers on Google?</p>\n<p>In\
    \ this talk I want to talk about a paradigm for embedded help that makes documentation\
    \ content available right in the application, no matter if it\u2019s a video tutorial,\
