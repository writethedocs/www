    and it’s depressing to think about! However, what AI is inevitably going to do
    is read the docs, and then? Then we can talk.</p>

    <p>I recently inherited maintenance responsibilities for a docs site that already
    had some AI tooling built into it – note, I probably would not have done this
    myself – and gradually found myself more and more impressed. AI search in docs
    complements our “traditional” search functionality, and many search and AI docs
    integrations are providing UX that is genuinely configurable, transparent, and
    accessible.</p>

    <p>Better still, docs AI is able to scrape several other entry points – GitHub
    issues, developer forums and community Slacks; essentially everything that would
    normally fall under the umbrella of “Community” – and integrate them into query
    responses. And unlike many AI agents in other domains, docs AI integrations can
    always be made to cite their sources, driving traffic back to the relevant source
    material. Did I mention the usefulness of the query logs for finding coverage
    gaps?</p>

    <p>This talk will compare the state of the art of docs AI tooling across several
    vendors, and demonstrate the way that it’s been helpful to us. It will be delivered
    by someone who is skeptical-bordering-on-hostile to AI in other domains, but who
    loves helping people access our docs across contexts so darn much that he can’t
    help but be impressed here. It will also not include a single horror story about
    trying or being pressured to write our docs with AI, because the best part of
    this tooling is that it points us in the exact opposite direction.</p>'

  abstract: '<p>As a technical writer leading documentation initiatives, I observed
    a persistent challenge: while documenting new products and features follows established
    processes, improving existing content often lacks a systematic approach - both
    due to limited bandwidth and insufficient data. The traditional approach of relying
    solely on doc metrics and sporadic customer feedback wasn''t providing a full
    picture of where and how to improve the documentation. </p>

    <p>Discover how combining the expertise of technical writers and support engineers
    can revolutionize your documentation improvement process through systematic, data-driven
    collaboration. Drawing from my experience, I''ll demonstrate how teams can harness
    multiple data sources - documentation analytics, support ticket data, and direct
    support cases - to drive strategic content improvements. You''ll learn how to
    establish a collaborative rhythm where technical writers and support engineers
    work together to share and expand their expertise. </p>

    <p>This approach has proven transformative beyond documentation quality. You''ll
    discover practical strategies for combining diverse data sources to prioritize
    improvements and measure impact, while building a scalable process where both
    teams grow: technical writers deepen their product technical knowledge through
    real support cases, and support engineers strengthen their technical communication
    skills. </p>

    <p>Whether you''re a documentation manager looking to implement data-driven processes,
    a technical writer seeking to balance new feature documentation with post-launch
    documentation improvements, or a support lead aiming to better utilize your team''s
    insights, you''ll walk away with actionable strategies to transform your documentation
    process.</p>

    <p>Key takeaways:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>A framework for identifying and prioritizing documentation improvements using
    multiple data sources</li>

    <li>Strategies for effective collaboration between technical writers and support
    engineers</li>

    <li>Methods for measuring and validating content improvements through documentation
    and support metrics</li>

    <li>Techniques for balancing new feature documentation with existing content improvement</li>

    <li>Approaches for using support cases to enhance technical writers'' domain expertise</li>

    docs repo. Slowly, realization and then dread grows. The large documentation repository
    you’ve inherited is outdated. It lacks coherent structure. There is no company
    style guide, and the industry style guide - the one that was supposed to guide
    prior technical writers - was not followed consistently. There are no documented
    processes, even for setting up your tools. In addition, your tools are severely

    secondhand that a customer complained about the documentation—especially when
    it’s a nebulous complaint that leaves no clear path for improvement. Receiving
    quality user feedback is often seen as the Holy Grail of documentation: elusive,
    invaluable, and transformative. Yet, gathering relevant, actionable insights is
    an ongoing challenge.</p>

    <p>In June 2024, SailPoint embarked on a journey to address this challenge by
    adding a mechanism for users to provide feedback directly on our documentation
    pages.</p>

    <p>While implementing a comment option isn’t groundbreaking, this presentation
    will focus on what we discovered during our quest: the lessons about our value
    as tech writers, the priorities we identified in gathering user feedback, and
    how user engagement can drive meaningful improvements in both documentation and
    the product itself.</p>

    <p>Key takeaways include:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Building a Feedback System That Works: Learn the essential components needed
    to ensure your feedback mechanism encourages constructive input instead of becoming
    a pile of complaints.</li>

    <li>Making Connections: Discover how fostering cross-functional teamwork and community
    building enhances the feedback-gathering process.</li>

    <li>Adapting to Your Team’s Realities: Learn strategies for tailoring your feedback
    approach to fit your team’s constraints without sacrificing impact.</li>

    <li>Amplifying User Voices: Understand how to ensure the right stakeholders hear

    systems, and what that means for bringing a device to market and managing documentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Oh,
    there’s a battery in that? Well then…” \nWe’ll delve into the ever-evolving and
    very global world of industry-specific standards, and how seemingly small details
    can throw everything you think you knew off balance. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“That
    made perfect sense in English.” \nIn some markets, products cannot be sold unless
    documentation is available in the local language. We’ll consider the role translation
    plays, both before you even start writing and well after you finish. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“No
    man, it’s the BOM!” \nFinally, we’ll look at how the long-ignored topic of cybersecurity
    in the medical device industry has suddenly risen to the top, not only as part
    of the device development process, but also within your documentation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Along
    the way, I’ll offer up some tips about anticipating areas of conflict within regulations
    and standards as well as planning for international use cases, and also provide

    that doesn''t match the UI. Sometimes it''s a one-and-done broken relationship—a
    critical procedure that fails at a key moment. You don''t always get a second
    chance.</p>

    <p>When product updates are frequent, it''s easy to accept that outdated docs
    are a sad reality of our work, but that doesn''t have to be the case. "Docs as
    Tests" is a strategy that transforms docs from a liability to a trusted asset
    by <em>literally</em> treating documentation as testable assertions of product
    behavior.

    This talk demonstrates how to implement Docs as Tests to catch documentation issues
    before your users do. I''ll show you:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>How to identify testable assertions in your docs, from simple UI procedures
    to complex API workflows</li>

    <li>Practical examples of testing docs against web interfaces, APIs, and CLIs
    using tools you likely already have or could easily adopt</li>

    <li>Techniques for maintaining test coverage as your documentation grows</li>

    <li>Real examples of how testing caught breaking changes before they impacted
    users</li>

    <li>Strategies for building support across engineering, product, and leadership
    teams</li>

    </ul>

    <p>You''ll leave with concrete steps to start testing your own docs, whether you''re
    a solo writer or part of a larger team. The result? Documentation that stays accurate
    as your product changes, building and maintaining user trust.</p>

    <p>This talk is for anyone who''s tired of finding out their docs are broken from
    their users. No programming experience required—just a desire to make your docs

    about how I made that leap. They often jump directly to the practical: how did
    you become a technical writer in software, if you went in only knowing how to
    analyze Shakespeare? Are there any courses you took that made you Officially Technical?
    Is there a book I can read that will transform me into a Technical Person? You
    get to a point where your commit history stops being embarrassing...right?</p>\n<p>It
    can feel like a letdown or a cop-out when I tell them the answer to all of those
    questions is no (the last one resoundingly so).</p>\n<p>Picking up new skills
    can sometimes feel intimidating - and it’s easy to go to work every day without
    examining your assumptions, thought patterns or habits, so that process might
    not improve. But when I started thinking about the successful technical writers
    in my life, I noticed they share a pattern of attitudes and behaviours that make
    picking up technical skills an easier, and even deeply satisfying, part of the
    job.</p>\n<p>Adapting similar attitudes can keep your learning process moving,
    and building up those technical skills will happen naturally as part of getting
    your writing tasks done. In doing so, you'll find that <strong>the real secret
    to being \"technical\" isn't any specific skill you have - it's a habit.</strong></p>\n<p>So
    I've come up with seven suggestions for building habits that are still practical,
    but that feed the underlying drive and ability to pick up technical skills:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Don't
    essentialize your lack of experience\n   (i.e., don't tell yourself, \"I'm not
    a technical person\" - tell yourself, \"I haven't learned this technical skill
    yet\")</li>\n<li>Redirect overwhelm into curiosity</li>\n<li>Turn your knowledge
    gaps into specific questions</li>\n<li>Get tinkering</li>\n<li>Notice how many
    people you admire are in the same boat</li>\n<li>Don't let \"perfect\" become
    the enemy of \"good enough\"</li>\n<li>Learn to love the process - and know if
    you can't</li>\n</ol>"

    <p>As a writer, you also know that those opinions aren’t usually based on real
    theory or practical experience and can sometimes lead to a lot of wasted time
    for the writing team. But what can you do when an important stakeholder gives

    <p>This talk will dive deep into how to conduct a competitive analysis to effectively
    convince stakeholders–whether you have a good idea you want to implement or you

    Maybe it''s a kraken that you lovingly grew yourself: from scratch as part of
    a new project, or as a redesign intended to get rid of a previous monster.</p>

    <p>In this talk I will walk through why I built two krakens for the MinIO docs.
    Each solved (or introduced) specific problems around single sourcing, cross referencing,
    extendability, and ease-of-use as our overall product grew in size and complexity.</p>

    <p>I’ll talk about the problems our team faced as our company’s product catalog
    grew into a mixed ecosystem of Open Source and Proprietary software across operating
    systems and infrastructures. I’ll talk about technical considerations - why we
    chose one tool or feature to solve a problem and the problems we predicted and
    actually encountered as a result. We’ll end on the Great Question that eventually
    raises about our special home-grown monsters - is it time to wield the great harpoon
    of a redesign and put our Krakens into retirement?</p>

    <p>I’ll give you a spoiler: the answer is probably no. We ultimately build new
    (and hopefully better) monsters in our pursuit of problem solving. And that’s
    OK, because we did solve the problem. Are there numerous other ways to have solved
    that problem, and the new one, and the next one? Yes, but that will always be
    true. </p>

    <p>The take-away is to focus on using tooling to solve problems knowing that they
    are imperfect solutions, regardless of intent and the number of design sessions.
    Rather than avoiding the Kraken, accept it and harness the power of what you have
