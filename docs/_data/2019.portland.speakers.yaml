  title: Tutorials, Tooltips, and Popups…oh MY!  How to ease yourself and your users
    into in-app messaging.
- abstract: '<p>SDK docs written by developers tend to be implementer oriented, not
    user oriented. That makes sense, since it''s the implementers writing them. Unfortunately,
    this approach leads to some frustrating SDK reference manual experiences for users.
    The implementer-oriented doc writer tends to answer, "What is this built on?"
    As a user, I need docs that tell me, "What can I build with this?" </p>

    <p>I provide examples of common SDK docs pitfalls, then present the approach that
    I used updating the SDK documentation that our developers had created. My goal
    was to give users of those docs a quick, enjoyable, user-oriented experience.
    To do so, I identified the likely use cases, or flows, of our product. I then
    grouped all entities (classes, functions, etc.) of the docs into these flows.
    For each flow, I arranged the entities in "flow order".</p>

    <p>Having mapped out our codebase in this way, I was ready to begin adding content
    by following these principles:</p>

    <p>1) In the leading lines, answer: what is this for?

    2) Always link to the previous and next items in all flows and add "See Also"
    links.

    3) Add a code example that demonstrates this entity''s role in the flow.

    4) Call out gotchas that are likely to get in the user''s way when trying to use
    a flow. </p>

    <p>This process involved editing the actual code comments and committing to git,
    which required buy-in and trust from the SDK team. I will touch on some of the
    interpersonal challenges that can arise when docs team members want to edit the
    devs'' code, and how documentarians can feel empowered to get their hands dirty
    in the repo. I will discuss analytics and feedback data. And, of course, I''ll
    show some docs makeover results.</p>'

  title: 'SDK Reference Manuals: A flow-based approach'
- abstract: "<p>As an editor and a writing coach, I’ve seen people react badly to\
    \ changes in their writing. I’ve learned to be as gentle with writers at work\
    \ as I used to be with my kids when we were homeschooling. Adults don’t usually\
    \ run out of the room crying when you edit their text, but some of them have looked\
    \ like they wanted to. </p>\n<p>Homeschooling depends on a good relationship with\
    \ the kids. Forging a healthy relationship with my coworkers is just as necessary.\
    \ Harsh and rigid editing annihilates the essential communication that needs to\
    \ take place between us. Writers need to understand why I make edits and how those\
    \ edits will improve the final content. </p>\n<p>In this session, I will discuss\
    \ ways that you can hone your diplomatic skills to match your editorial skills,\
    \ whether you work as an editor full-time or only occasionally do peer reviews.\
    \ This talk outlines the principles I use when editing and gives concrete examples\
    \ of how I apply them at work and at home. </p>\n<p>EDITING PRINCIPLE 1. WE’RE\
    \ ALL ON THE SAME SIDE. \nAs an editor, I’m not criticizing the person whose work\
    \ I’m editing.  No, I’m helping that writer achieve a goal: creating content that\
    \ helps a customer get a job done. If the writer and I agree on the purpose of\
    \ the edits, we can agree on a lot more. </p>\n<p>EDITING PRINCIPLE 2. FOCUS ON\
    \ WHAT THE CUSTOMER IS TRYING TO DO. \nRed Hat’s customers are frequently systems\
    \ administrators and developers. When we write for them, content needs to match\
    \ their needs, not our own. Usability testing and talking to support engineers\
    \ both enable that kind of focus. Just like writing a novel is all about making\
    \ the story flow, technical communication is all about making the User Story flow.\
    \ </p>\n<p>EDITING PRINCIPLE 3. EDITING IS A CONVERSATION, NOT AN EDICT. \nSome\
    \ of my co-workers have had bad experiences with editors who changed content without\
    \ understanding why the writers wrote it a particular way. I treat edits as a\
    \ back-and-forth conversation, and I’ll show examples of these dialogs in my talk.\
    \ </p>\n<p>EDITING PRINCIPLE 4. EXPLAIN WHY. \nIf I’m editing someone’s content,\
    \ I take time to explain why I’ve made a particular edit. Granted, I can’t do\
    \ this every time, but I sprinkle this kind of information throughout the document.\
    \ Authors don’t care if I think it “sounds right” this way. Readability indexes,\
    \ usability research, style guides, minimalism, and other objective tools are\
    \ more persuasive than telling them to make a change “because I said so.”  That\
    \ approach didn’t work with my kids either. </p>\n<p>EDITING PRINCIPLE 5. \
    \ SEEK OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS. \nYou are not the only person who\
    \ can fine-tune a piece of content. Seeking out other experienced writers to review\
    \ a doc can give you insights that you would never have on your own. At Red Hat\
    \ we do crowdsourced peer review sessions, and they have made me a better editor.\
    \ This talk includes tips for leading an effective group peer review. If there\
    \ are multiple possibilities for improving a piece of content, several people\
    \ working together can sort out the optimal approach. </p>\n<p>Being a good editor\
    \ is a lot like being a good leader:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You need to edit people’s\
    \ content so that they WANT to make the changes that you want them to make. </li>\n\

  title: How to edit other people’s content without pissing them off
- abstract: '<p>In 2017, I opened up a project of mine—a JavaScript-based countdown
    clock to Halloween—to the open source community as part of Hacktoberfest. Within
    a few days, my project had generated a surprising amount of traction. Enough traction,
    that I had difficulty managing the request for changes in a timely fashion. Realizing
    that I was one person, maintaining a codebase in my spare time, I knew I needed
    to find a way to streamline the project so that I was working smarter, instead
    of harder.</p>

    <p>Enter documentation!</p>

    <p>While researching best practices and guides on maintaining an open source project,
    I learned that the #1 problem encountered in open source is incomplete or outdated
    documentation. This was huge! Knowing this, I could use documentation as a way
    to:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Be upfront about Code of Conduct expectations, licensing, goals, etc</li>

    <li>Provide an overview of the project, including technologies used, how to contribute
    and frequently asked questions</li>

    <li>Create fill-in-the-blank templates for common for pull request &amp; issues
    to ensure all necessary information is provided upfront</li>

    <li>Provide a log of changes made, bugs features added over the life of the project</li>

    </ul>

    <p>While I am far from a documentation expert I believe that open source projects—and
    their supporting documentation—can and should be inviting to people of all skill
    levels. Documenting items like how to get started, where to find key files, expectations,
    etc are easy wins that positively impact how people interact or contribute to
    your project.</p>

    more than ten years (and was even featured in a WTD newsletter back in August
    2017), few teams seem to practice it, and many have never even heard of it.</p>

    <p>About one year ago, our company decided to move our product development process
    from  “docs or it didn’t happen” to “docs or it <em>won’t</em> happen.” What has

    all three of these. But how often do you think about these roles in isolation?
    What''s the payoff of doing so?</p>

    <p>This talk will explore each of these perspectives in turn and will make the
    case that doing so can produce more empathetic, impactful, and relevant documentation.
    It will draw on my past experiences as an academic researcher and teacher, as
    well as my current work as a technical writer and editor. </p>

    <p>Topics we''ll cover:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Teaching philosophy: Do you have one? Is it visible to your readers? How does
    it motivate your writing?</li>

    <li>Formative/summative exercises, learning from design, and other helpful terms
    from the teaching profession: What are the desired learning outcomes of your documentation?
    How are you getting to these outcomes? How do you measure success?</li>

    <li>Thinking like an editor: What are the most common recommendations that editors
    make to technical writers? How can you turn these around to improve your work
    as a writer?</li>

    <li>Thinking like a writer: What are some challenges specific to writing and how

    career.</p>

    <p>The goal of the talk is to demonstrate how experience in non-tech writing roles
    can help you become, or improve your career as, a tech writer. Be clear that most
    any role includes some writing, and thinking back to your strengths as a writer
    in past roles can help you. I will discuss my past roles in tech support, QA,
    engineering, and as a project manager to help illustrate this. The hope is that
    this can help attendees who are considering a tech support role, writers who may
    not have considered how past experience can help them, and attendees who don''t
    want to make a living as a writer but must write a lot in their role. </p>

    from my background. I would make a concerted effort to ensure this is not an attempt
    to promote my resume. I would briefly emphasize that it took me a long time to
    finally find writing, and while the roles were valuable, each could be considered
    a hurdle to achieve a job I love. I would pitch this optimistically with the intent
    of showing that, if you''re for some reason thinking of a career change, and you''re
    at this conference, then you can open doors with experience you may not have considered.
    It can also show that if you already are a writer, you can finesse your writing
    using what you learned in past roles.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Tech support:<ul>

    <li>Use your skill at helping frustrated customers to write to your audience.
    Picture your audience and make it a goal to reduce tech support calls.</li>

    <li>Remember how you empathized with frustrated customers and incorporate that
    into your writing.</li>

    <li>Remember how you corresponded with customers via writing and strive for the
    same attempt to solve and please customers.</li>

  title: Harvest Past Experience to be a Great Tech Writer
- abstract: '<p>Analyzing documentation metrics is a great way to prioritize documentation
    work and resources. For example, identifying well-read or under-viewed documentation
    topics can guide which ones to work on—whether by revising well-read but less-updated
    documentation, or by doing more work to get helpful documentation more visible
    to readers by modifying titles or improving links to the topic. In this talk,
    I’ll cover what kinds of data to collect, how to gather that data, and how to
    use it to inform your documentation priorities. </p>

    <p>Learn what types of data to measure, such as page views, helpfulness ratings,
    time spent on page, and why to measure that data. In addition, I’ll discuss the
    value of measuring or gathering other types of data from sources—other websites
    within the organization, pull request issue tags, support cases, and sales/field
    requests—to help identify cross-functional needs that could shift your priorities.
    </p>

    <p>You’ll learn about using data to approximate the number of readers and their
    engagement with your documentation, and how to partner cross-functionally to gather
    additional contextual data such as total user base. I’ll provide basic guidelines
    around analyzing data and set expectations around the time it takes to manually
    interpret and categorize the data and make it useful for analysis. </p>

    <p>I’ll reinforce important points such as how and why to use data or measurements
    to make a decision, the purpose of measuring different types of data, and what
    types of conclusions you can draw from different sample sizes (e.g., small sample
    sizes are still valuable). Using data analysis, you’ll be able to identify topics
    with low engagement, or find popular topics that beg for a rewrite, and prioritize
    your documentation improvements accordingly.</p>'

  title: 'Just Add Data: Make it easier to prioritize your documentation '
- abstract: '<p>When I presented at WTD NA in 2017 (<a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/speakers/#speaker-jodie-putrino" target="_blank">Treating Documentation Like Code:
    A Practical Account</a>), an audience member asked me afterwards what organizational
    barriers I''d dealt with and how I got past them. At that point, the answer was
    "none" -- the road had been pretty easy so far. </p>

    <p>Fast-forward two years and my answer is now very different. My little docs-like-code
    project quickly gained traction across the company. As the adoption rate grew,
    so did the visibility of the project up the chain of the organization. The more
    people knew about it, the more they either wanted to join in or to stop it in
    its tracks. </p>

    <p>Through supportive education, thoughtful consideration, and consistency of
    messaging, I saw the project grow from a stop-gap solution to the basis for a
    burgeoning company-wide digital transformation effort. </p>

    <p>In this talk, I''ll use the elements of my journey to reflect on the following
    topics:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Helping others succeed ultimately helps you to succeed. </li>

    <li>You are the expert on your project. You are its best advocate.</li>

    <li>Approach roadblocks and pitfalls thoughtfully instead of emotionally.</li>

    <li>Be consistent in your messaging to bridge political discussions.  </li>

    <li>Be patient. Change takes time.   </li>

  title: 'Defying the Status Quo: How a grassroots effort can transform an organization'
- abstract: '<p>As a technical writer, I am focused on one major goal: my users’ success.
    I create clear reference topics, intuitive tasks, and delightful concepts. But
    what is the other writer at my company doing? How are they delighting their users?
    And are their users the same as mine?</p>

    <p>I write at a company whose products are modular. Customers use a blend of different
    products to achieve their goals. While I can write the most amazing documentation
    for product A, if a customer also uses product B, a different writer determined
    what those deliverables were. Sure, we have a style guide. The documentation looks
    like it came from the same company, but there’s work the user must do to put those
    pieces together.</p>

    <p>With 30+ years of baggage of creating technical documentation this way, our
    organization realized we needed a solution to bring order to the chaos. Thus,
    the Product Documentation Strategy was born. I want to share my story of transforming
    from a Technical Writer into an Information Architect (IA). As an IA, I now have
    two goals: my users’ success and the writers’ success. </p>

    <p>I will share why my team exists, how this is an upcoming trend in our industry,
    and some challenges and rewards I’ve seen on this journey. </p>'

  title: 'Product Documentation Strategy: What Is It and Why Do We Need It?'
- abstract: "<p>As documentarians, we know that knowledge is critical: accurate and comprehensive documentation drives product awareness and adoption. For engineers and other technologists, detailed documentation is essential for development velocity, code quality, and the reliability of services running in production.</p>
    <p>But the stakes are higher and go beyond our own companies and projects. To be successful, and to benefit from the economic advancement offered by the software industry, all developers everywhere need access to the knowledge needed to fully participate in technology. Tribal knowledge is accessible only by the privileged few. Documentation - comprehensive, accessible, and trustworthy documentation - is what puts the means of production in the hands of the developer, whether she's in Palo Alto, Lagos, Quito, or Chengdu. This talk covers how documentarians - especially those working in open source - can, literally, change lives.</p>"
