    site search. In this talk I''ll tell the story of technical and social considerations
    that went into implementing search on api.slack.com and the philosophy that''s
    gone into shaping it after.</p>

    <p>We implemented search using Algolia''s REST API after a long time spent narrowing
    options. Initially we weren''t sure if we wanted to build it in house, or host
    it on a different site entirely. Conflicts with security and the need for as few
    dependencies as possible forced us into an implementation that even Algolia itself
    doesn''t recommend.</p>

    <p>As we move forward, we''re considering the best way to give users relevant
    results while gently directing them away from old API''s and unsupported features.
    I''ll discuss options like visual indicators of age on a search result, smart
    catalog building/prioritization, and the cost of manually adjusting search. </p>'

  abstract: '<p>There are software companies that have undervalued documentation or
    are still in the process of integrating it as an essential part of the software
    development life cycle. This has caused them to generate a documentation debt,
    which has led to:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Confusing and disorganized documents.</li>

    <li>Scattered and inconsistent information sources. </li>

    <li>A lack of documentation altogether.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Coming into a fast-moving agile work environment as an information developer,
    I found there is often little time and insufficient resources to resolve that
    debt. Chances are that you are required to work on current documentation requirements
    in favor of business continuity. The following questions then arise: “How can
    we tackle both current documentation needs and the existing documentation debt?”
    “And, is that even possible and necessary?” To the latter, I say yes and yes!
    Even more, I argue that companies are open to listen when you speak their language.</p>

    <p>The former question I aim to answer in this talk. I cover how to come up with
    an actionable strategy to tackle the existing documentation debt while also dealing
    with incoming documentation needs (for new products, versions, features, bugs,
    …). Amongst others, it involves:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Defining the problem of documentation debt in your company.</li>

    <li>Finding the business value to obtain resources, convince management, and invite
    stakeholder collaboration.</li>

    <li>Forming the documentation debt into a product by designing a solution. </li>

    <li>Understanding how your company works and handles business continuity.</li>

    <li>Creating a strategy and roadmap for your product.</li>

    <li>Organizing and managing your time so that the long-term does not interfere
    with the short-term.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>In short, it requires wearing many hats, such as that of a product owner and
    project manager, and extensive collaboration with different stakeholders. What
    this talk really wants to bring across is that <em>it is possible</em> to come
    up with a balancing act that satisfies both the short-term and long-term documentation
    demands. </p>'

    advancements in content authoring systems.</p>

    <p>As a technical writer and engineer in the Docs Product team at Stripe, I''m
    responsible for developing the new authoring system for our next-generation documentation
    platform. In this presentation, I''ll cover:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>How investing in richer documentation that provides a more engaging and intuitive
    experience can increase the success of our users and help them get to market faster
    with our products</li>

    <li>How we''re dynamically tailoring content for individual readers and selectively
    surfacing relevant information to users with specialized requirements, based on
    factors like geographic location and attributes of the user''s logged-in account</li>

    <li>How we''ve evolved our authoring system towards a fully declarative format
    that supports user-specific customization, client-side interactivity, and deep
    static analysis while keeping code decoupled from content</li>

    <li>How our cross-functional Docs Product team treats our documentation as an
    application, driving concurrent improvements to both the user-facing documentation
    experience and internal authoring tools</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Features like dynamic content generation, contextual awareness, and client-side
    interactivity are making documentation more like software. But taking advantage
    of these features leads to more code creeping into content, resulting in a steeper
    learning curve that can potentially discourage participation from prospective
    documentation contributors. In this presentation, I''ll share the lessons learned
    while building an extensible Markdown-based content format that supports application-like
    user experiences and provides the technical advantages of documentation-as-code
    while avoiding the complexity and elevated barrier to entry, ensuring that content
    authoring remains inclusive and accessible.</p>'

    old one’s painful and frustrating to use? Migrating documentation can feel overwhelming,
    especially when so many people rely on it, and the expectations are high.</p>

    <p>The good news is, migration doesn’t have to be scary. Using a recent experience
    where we had to migrate Customer Support’s knowledge from our old tool (Confluence)
    to a new tool (Guru) as an example, this talk will go over the 7-step process
    of how anyone can migrate their docs as smoothly as possible:</p>

    <ol>

    <li>Use a project plan to track work, manage time and keep stakeholders updated.
    </li>

    <li>Audit your docs so only updated and useful content is moved over. </li>

    <li>Establish a foundation with a set information architecture and a structured
    search/tagging system. </li>

    <li>Break up the work into blocks.</li>

    <li>Develop a launch + training plan to make the change easy on your users.</li>

    <li>Migrate the documentation as planned.</li>

    <li>End of the project with a retrospective and report for closure.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Doing all this preparation is key to a successful migration to the new tool,
    so you’re able to anticipate and overcome any barriers that arise and complete
    your project deliverables on time and on budget. A successful migration means
    your users are more empowered and educated to find docs in your new tool; your
    stakeholders are happy; and most importantly, people are finally reading your
    valuable documentation!</p>'

    in customer service to one in technical writing and knowledge-centered service
    work. Here''s how I did it, and how my support background has helped and influenced
    my tech writing work. When I was a technical support engineer at Duo Security,
    I gained a good understanding of our customer''s most common issues, and insight
    into the approach our support team takes in solving a customer''s issue. Now as
    a technical writer, I''m able to use that experience to work on projects and develop
    content that will help deflect support volume. Duo uses a slightly modified version
    of the "Knowledge-Centered Service," which means that, in addition to the step-by-step
    product documentation created by our Engineering team, we have an internal and
    public knowledge base that captures any troubleshooting steps, common questions,
    and best practices for our customer and customer-facing teams.</p>

    <p>My primary role is editing and publishing crowd-sourced content from our customer-facing
    teams. Just last quarter we published more than 200 articles written by our 23
    support engineers alone, and lots of other teams contribute. While the crowd-sourced
    articles are great, I had an idea for something else I could focus my time on
    during work: I had anecdotal evidence, based on my experience in support, that
    new customers were reaching out to support before reading the documentation or
    searching the knowledge base. But why? What information were they receiving in
    the early stages? What information should they be receiving?</p>

    <p>To better understand the customer journey from the moment they sign up for
    a trial account, I devised a plan to audit support cases created by customers
    in their first 90 days of having an account. I wanted to compare the questions
    they were asking with the content they receive in email campaigns, as well as
    review whether the topics are covered in our documentation or in the knowledge
    base already.</p>'

    national laboratories and universities, we have developed an approach that embraces
    the idea of “document driven development”, by making all our documentation runnable
    within our continuous integration test suite. Most notably, for our tutorials
    and examples, we re-use a set of Jupyter Notebooks in three ways: as the base
    for “live” tutorials and demos, as static documentation disseminated on web pages
    (and other generated forms), and as integration tests that we run in our continuous
    integration system.  While the idea of runnable examples is not new, their full
    realization as both a document that can be used to guide a room full of workshop
    attendees through a tutorial, and as a detailed test of the software, is not common
    in open scientific computing. But, fundamentally, this is not a difficult task
    and should arguably become a standard approach, regardless of the specific technologies
    used. We have found that this approach has helped maximize the limited software
    engineering resources and combined the skillsets of scientist/programmers and
    programmer/software-engineer/devops in the same project. </p>

  abstract: '<p>Diagrams are an excellent tool for documenting the architecture of
    our software systems: they’re information dense and they utilize the visual circuits
    of our brains to create effective learning experiences. Many of us create or update
    such diagrams regularly; there have been many talks on this topic at this conference
    over the years.</p>

    <p>As great as diagrams can be, they have some downsides. In particular, they
    tend to lock up massive amounts of rich and crucial information into a format
    that can’t be reused in any other context. Because the information is locked up,
    it tends to be duplicated in various places in various formats and it takes significant
    effort to keep those duplicative datasets in sync.</p>

    <p>I’ve recently come to believe that there’s a better way: modeling. If we model
    our systems in data, and make that data accessible, we are creating a single centralized
    source of truth for what systems, datastores, datasets, services, and people (roles)
    we have, and how they relate to each other. </p>

    <p>There are many uses for that dataset; it’s not just a model, it’s also a catalog,
    or registry, of <em>what is there even</em> — a catalog that many people across
    an org need, and will be motivated to keep up to date. For example, anyone tasked
    with data governance needs to know what datastores and datasets exist, and who
    and what interacts with them. Security auditors need similar information.</p>

    <p>Diagrams are another of the many uses of that dataset, and our diagrams can
    be greatly improved by being based on models of our systems. Multiple diagrams
    (“views”) can include the same elements of the model, but those elements are defined
    only once, in the model. If we change an element, we can quickly and easily re-render
    all the diagrams that include that element.</p>

    <p>I’ll describe various benefits of documenting software architecture as data
    and share how I’ve been doing so, and describe my plans for improving the tools
    and approach. I’ll show lots of examples and try to wrap it all up at the end
    with an enthusiastic yet gentle call to action.</p>'
