    learn new ones. Project maintainers are always looking for new folks to help out
    with various aspects of the project, especially when it comes to documentation.
    But how do you get started? </p>

    <p>For me, this was the most overwhelming question when I first started in open
    source a few years ago. Coming from a background in closed source, stepping into
    the open source world felt a lot like stepping into Wonderland to me. There were
    so many new terms to learn, new ways of doing things, and, the scariest of all,
    I now had to do everything in front of the whole world. EEEK! </p>

    <p>Looking back over my journey starting out as a nervous newbie and transitioning
    to technical documentation lead for prominent open source projects (Harbor and
    Velero), I''ll share some lessons learned and tips on how you can get started
    on your adventure in the world of open source, including</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Researching your path and picking an open source project that fits you</li>

    <li>Gearing up for the trip by getting familiar with commonly used tools and terms</li>

    <li>Plotting your course and knowing what you want out of the experience</li>

    <li>Being ready to ask for help when you need directions</li>

    <li>Remembering you don’t need to get there in a day, start by setting small goals</li>

    <p>Facing a project large enough not to be completable in one go, and that won''t
    have much value until it''s actually complete, we often feel we don''t know how
    to begin. Complex projects lure us into creating frighteningly complex plans,

    we are staring at a mountain of our own making. </p>

    <p>It''s a trap! It''s by no means exclusive to documentation, but we documentation
    writers fall into it particularly hard.</p>

    <p>I fall into it often. I see colleagues and clients do it too.</p>

    <p><strong>We fall into this trap because we confuse the finished with the complete</strong>.
    The way out is to understand that, as a living project, <strong>our documentation
    will never be finished, but can always be complete</strong>.</p>

    <li>several <strong>practical, immediately usable strategies and techniques</strong>

    are your fellow community members, customers, coworkers, and open source peers.
    As such, writing documentation without taking the needs of the neurodivergent
    community into account will result in not only unhappy users, but unhappy contributors
    also. </p>

    <p>Writing documentation is a skill that requires effort, dedication, and commitment
    to improving not only the particular project you’re working on but also the wider
    open source community as a whole. However, technical documentation and contributor
    guidelines may be unclear to contributors who are neurodivergent.</p>

    <p>Neurodivergent individuals can often face challenges in the following areas
    when contributing to open source and writing or reading documentation, which can
    include:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Identifying a DRI for an issue if an organization or project’s hierarchy is

    <li>Implied ‘best people to contact,’ that one only knows about if they are already

    <li>Unclear descriptions of where to get started on their contributor journey</li>

    <li>Language that assumes a particular skill set or experience level with a particular

    <p>Coming from organizations where I was primarily writing documentation using

    <p>At the Wikimedia Foundation, we use maturity models to guide our docs development

    help us to gain a more honest and holistic understanding of our work and its impact
    than we can with traditional metrics alone. They allow us to decouple our definition
    of success from abstract numbers. Instead of telling us how far or how fast we
    are going, maturity models allow us to see where we have been, where we are, and
    where we are headed. They give us clarity about what we’re doing well and what
    we need to improve.</p>

    would barely write anything without referring to God, so if you want a medieval

    <li>how craftspeople in the Renaissance would use old books, and scraps of paper,
    to make boxes. This preserved writing never intended for posterity (posterity
    in the form of a box, no less!) What can we learn from this? Come and find out!</li>

    <li>what''s the use, in 2021, of what is effectively a medieval sticky note saying

    <p>Open-sourcing your documentation holds the promise of a huge pool of dedicated
    volunteer writers, but at the risk of reduced quality and coherence. It is easy
    to think that more help means less work, but is that really the case? What is
    the impact on the organization and on the release schedule? </p>

    <p>At <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/">ScyllaDB</a>, we considered these questions
    and decided that 2020 was the year to go open. Our code was already open-sourced,
    but our documentation was not. As the company grew, the docs became harder to
    manage, especially with only one dedicated technical writer.  We considered the
    risks of how much time we would spend and wondered if it would impact the release
    cycle. Our solution included recruiting our developers to be active contributors
    and after we saw this was successful, we open-sourced our documentation. The decisions
    we made were not simple, we had to endure a painful migration, and we learned
    many valuable lessons along the way. In the end, we concluded that the time spent
    gave us a good foundation and we feel we have built an atmosphere where contributors
    would feel welcome and have created design decisions to make it easy to contribute
    to docs. </p>
