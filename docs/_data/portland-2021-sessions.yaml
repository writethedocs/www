    learn new ones. Project maintainers are always looking for new folks to help out
    with various aspects of the project, especially when it comes to documentation.
    But how do you get started? </p>

    <p>For me, this was the most overwhelming question when I first started in open
    source a few years ago. Coming from a background in closed source, stepping into
    the open source world felt a lot like stepping into Wonderland to me. There were
    so many new terms to learn, new ways of doing things, and, the scariest of all,
    I now had to do everything in front of the whole world. EEEK! </p>

    <p>Looking back over my journey starting out as a nervous newbie and transitioning
    to technical documentation lead for prominent open source projects (Harbor and
    Velero), I''ll share some lessons learned and tips on how you can get started
    on your adventure in the world of open source, including</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Researching your path and picking an open source project that fits you</li>

    <li>Gearing up for the trip by getting familiar with commonly used tools and terms</li>

    <li>Plotting your course and knowing what you want out of the experience</li>

    <li>Being ready to ask for help when you need directions</li>

    <li>Remembering you don’t need to get there in a day, start by setting small goals</li>

    <p>The documentation writer who has sat staring at a blank page wondering how
    and where to get started will find this familiar. A large documentation restructuring
    project can have exactly the same paralysing effect.</p>

    <p>Facing a project large enough not to be completable in one go, and that won''t
    have much value until it''s actually complete, we often feel we don''t know how
    to begin. Complex projects lure us into creating frighteningly complex plans,
    that we draw all the way to our envisaged finish-lines. The next thing we know
    we are staring at a mountain of our own making. </p>

    <p>It''s a trap! It''s by no means exclusive to documentation, but we documentation
    writers fall into it particularly hard.</p>

    <p>I fall into it often. I see colleagues and clients do it too.</p>

    <p><strong>We fall into this trap because we confuse the finished with the complete</strong>.
    The way out is to understand that, as a living project, <strong>our documentation
    will never be finished, but can always be complete</strong>.</p>

    <p>Understanding this gives us:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>several <strong>practical, immediately usable strategies and techniques</strong>

    <li>a <strong>general approach to documentation</strong> that helps steer us around

    <li>an <strong>incremental, evolutionary way of working</strong> on large documentation
    tasks that makes every step, from the very first one, a value-adding improvement</li>

    are your fellow community members, customers, coworkers, and open source peers.
    As such, writing documentation without taking the needs of the neurodivergent

    also. </p>

    <p>Writing documentation is a skill that requires effort, dedication, and commitment
    to improving not only the particular project you’re working on but also the wider

    guidelines may be unclear to contributors who are neurodivergent.</p>

    <p>Neurodivergent individuals can often face challenges in the following areas

    include:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Identifying a DRI for an issue if an organization or project’s hierarchy is

    <li>Unclear descriptions of where to get started on their contributor journey</li>

    of success from abstract numbers. Instead of telling us how far or how fast we

    where we are headed. They give us clarity about what we’re doing well and what

    in which tech writers work actually want their own software products described
    in such a way that the content is easily understandable. And to get to that point,
    a tech writer needs to understand the product in-depth. What better way than to
    test it/use it by themselves as a user would?\nAt the other side of the writing
    spectrum is the tester. The person who needs to make sure everything software
    engineers programmed works as planned. And in most cases, make sure that whoever
    comes after them, knows what steps to take to ensure that the new software release
    didn't break a legacy feature (why good regression tests exist). A well-written

  abstract: '<p>This year, like many of you, I binged on the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10048342/">Queen’s
    Gambit</a>. In chess, a <em>gambit</em> is a move where you sacrifice a chess
    piece in the hope to put yourself in a more advantageous position.  When the gambit
    is presented to the opponent, they can either accept or deny it. If the strategy
    works for the opponent it is considered to be sound. </p>

    <p>Open-sourcing your documentation holds the promise of a huge pool of dedicated
    volunteer writers, but at the risk of reduced quality and coherence. It is easy
    to think that more help means less work, but is that really the case? What is
    the impact on the organization and on the release schedule? </p>

    <p>At <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/">ScyllaDB</a>, we considered these questions
    and decided that 2020 was the year to go open. Our code was already open-sourced,
    but our documentation was not. As the company grew, the docs became harder to
    manage, especially with only one dedicated technical writer.  We considered the
    risks of how much time we would spend and wondered if it would impact the release
    cycle. Our solution included recruiting our developers to be active contributors
    and after we saw this was successful, we open-sourced our documentation. The decisions
    we made were not simple, we had to endure a painful migration, and we learned
    many valuable lessons along the way. In the end, we concluded that the time spent
    gave us a good foundation and we feel we have built an atmosphere where contributors
    would feel welcome and have created design decisions to make it easy to contribute
    to docs. </p>

    <p>This talk explains how we created a documentation community and created an
    atmosphere where everyone involved understands their role and is eager to help.
    Our work is not completely done, but by the time the talk is held, we will have
    gained enough experience to share what we thought about and what we have learned.</p>

    <p>You will receive tips, best practices, examples, and anecdotes that discuss:</p>

    to speed</li>

    and reviews with teams inside and outside your organization</li>

    <li>Get Everyone on-board: How to align the entire organization to think about
    and contribute to the documentation. Convert the naysayers into cheerleaders.</li>
