  abstract: <p>As a technical communicator, how often do you struggle to translate
    complex ideas into brilliant content? Is this the result of a highly diversified
    documentation team? Or do your subject matter experts waste too much time churning
    out ineffective documentation? </p><p>How can you simplify technical subjects
    to straightforward ideas that are accompanied by a few long overdue ‘aha’ moments?
    </p><p>It is widely accepted that sustainable content makes for a strong and positive
    impact, especially when implemented over a period of time. Substantial cost-savings
    in human and machine translations are easily achieved by simplifying your technical
    English content. This is because when sentences are simpler and less ambiguous,
    they become easier and less expensive to translate. </p><p>What qualifies as sustainable
    content and how does STE drive this change towards efficient content management,
    reuse, and ultimately self-driven workflow processes? </p><p>With over 15 years
    of experience working with software documentation writers who wish to become proficient
    in the STE language standard, we find that many readers and users of their existing
    documentation get confused at times when information is not being conveyed in
    a very clear, easy-to-understand manner, and language can be a reason.</p><p>This
    presentation will demonstrate how industry best practices based on STE principles
    are used for standardising the English language of your technical content. Thanks
    to this standardisation, a number of benefits towards sustainability can be achieved:</p><ol><li>A
    robust industry-specific terminology</li><li>Leaner translation memories to facilitate
    reuse</li><li>Technical accuracy.</li></ol>

  abstract: <p>Lately, there was a discussion in the tech writing community about
    a scientific basis for technical writing. </p><p>For instance, developers have
    computer science which includes algorithms, theory of computation, information
    theory, and automation, marketing managers have an economic theory and behavioral
    theory at their disposal.  Therefore, technical writers suffer from imposter syndrome
    because our expertise is based on practice, not formal theory. But it would be
    misleading to believe that technical writing has no scientific basis. </p><p>In
    this talk, I want to go through the main theoretical basics of technical writing
    (cognitive science, psychology, andragogy, rationality and system thinking, statistics,
    information design, and visual literacy) and let us all see the bits of it in
    our day-to-day tasks. So that everyone can tell "You know, I am something of a
    scientist myself". </p><p>I will draw a technical communication lifecycle and
    we go through each stage together searching for scientific basements and applied
    theory.</p>

    on the other side of the interviews; interviewee. For the first time in my career,
    I got the opportunity to interview a candidate. The recruitment and interviewing
    process is a tense situation, not only for the interviewee but also for the interviewer.</p><p>Even
    though I was pretty anxious but at the same time excited, I prepared myself to
    be the best interviewer possible. So that I can help my organization to pick the
    most suitable candidate using my tech and soft skills. I did a thorough research
    before interviewing my future teammate and want to share a few tips, specially
    for a first-time Tech Writer Interviewer.</p>

    Other jobs are like arriving on a planet that has never heard of content or docs.
    This is the story of how - as the first tech writer in the business - I brought
    the chaos under control, restructured a knowledge base, filled in the content
    gaps, and made the business take ownership of the docs. </p><p>In this talk I’ll
    share the methods and approach I used in workshops, the kinds of conversations
    I had, and the stakeholders that I reached. To finish off, I’ll talk about the
    challenges that remain, the lessons learned and the side effects of leaving a
    business wanting more.</p>

  abstract: <p>Technical Documentation can leave a major footprint on the web, sometimes
    consisting of dozens if not hundreds of pages of content. This footprint plays
    a major role in the discovery, usage, and developer satisfaction of platforms
    or products. So why then does documentation tend to be so unoptimized for searchability?
    In this talk, we'll explore the role SEO plays in helping developers find the
    documentation they need, using real-world examples from Dolby's own developer
    platform Dolby.io. Additionally, we'll highlight some of the tools we built and
    tips we learned, improving and growing docs.dolby.io's online presence.</p>

  abstract: <p>Product-led Growth (PLG) is a go-to-market strategy being adopted by
    a growing number of SaaS companies. PLG is based on generating sales from customers
    using the product and succeeding with as little interaction with sales and field
    teams as possible. A pillar of implementing a PLG strategy is enabling users to
    onboard and succeed in the product as quickly and easily as possible. This positions
    Knowledge Experience as a leading pillar in the overall growth and success of
    a company.</p>

    I never imagined I would land three internships as a Technical Writer. Everything

    to introduce you to the step-by-step process of customer journey mapping and share
    my internship experiences. It never occurred to me that journey mapping could
    accomplish such amazing things. Usually, user experience engineers conduct the
    majority of journey mapping. As a writer, when it''s your turn to identify flaws,
    improve, or update your documents, it''s the best way to go. As I have experienced
    it, I will describe the following:</p><p>The benefits of conducting a Journey

    you have to wrangle an unpredictable, at-will, motley crew of amateur technical
    writers who don’t always produce the quality of documentation you want to present
    to the world. How do you keep your community hyped without lowering your standards?
    </p><p>Sarah will share some of the strategies she uses to get the best out of
    Astro’s community-driven, open source documentation: from how to address the dreaded
    “unsolicited PR” to tips for establishing a culture and process that improves
    submissions before they ever reach your inbox. She describes how “settling for
    less” can actually give you more, by cultivating an attitude of #NWTWWHB (“not

    that go wrong in docs from a security perspective, from giving away too much to
    giving away too little, and the kinds of harm erroneous docs can do; what “secure”
    documentation looks like; and how security professionals themselves can improve
    their work through documentation development.</p>
