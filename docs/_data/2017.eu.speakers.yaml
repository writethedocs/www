    <p>As the old saying goes, “you never get a second chance to make a first impression”. When you first meet someone new (not least at a conference for documentarians!), those first few moments set the tone. In exactly the same way, the experience your user has when they first “meet” your product and get to grips with it will set the tone for your entire relationship with them.</p>
    <p>As documentarians, we so often focus on building detailed and exhaustive “reference” documentation, but in doing that, we forget to provide the right kind of “getting started” experience for a user brand new to our product. </p>
    <p>At GoCardless, we spent the first years of the life of our platform focused on building high-quality reference documentation. But in Summer 2016, we kicked off a big piece of work on a new set of resources: a “getting started” guide for our API, getting the user from nought-to-sixty on our developer platform.</p>
    <p>To make the right first impression, we had to turn things on their head and think from the reader’s perspective. From this perspective, what we’ll write and build looks very different to our “reference” documentation, seeking not only to teach the user how to use our product, but also to explain the fundamental concepts behind it and to bring the user to the all-important “aha!” moment where they see the value in what we’re offering.</p>
    <p>In this talk, I’ll go through:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the fundamental differences between “reference” and “getting started” documentation</li>
    <li>the lessons we learnt on the way as we experimented and spent extensive time with end users</li>
    <li>what we built</li>
    <li>the results — from our users’ perspective, and in terms of how we build demand within the company for further “getting started” content</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As a former journalist, I tend to think in terms of storytelling. As an open source evangelist, I invite you to do the same. What you share on GitHub tells a story about you, your development practices, and your openness to others in the open source community. If you're motivated to gain users, contributors, and positive feedback about your projects, then building a compelling, coherent narrative is essential. </p>
    <p>In this presentation, I'll share insights gained from curating Zalando's GitHub repository so we can tell a better story. I'll describe how we've used GitHub and other tools to create guidelines and processes that bring sanity to our storytelling. And I'll talk about how focusing on higher-quality docs has helped us to instill a stronger product mindset in our development teams. Writing a README, for example, offers an opportunity to tell the world why a project exists, how it works (and why), what makes it unique, and how it might evolve over time. I'll discuss how this process not only empowers developers, but also those of us who are technical writers and storytellers—offering several real-life examples to (hopefully) inspire you.</p>
    <p>From 400+ projects of widely differing quality, reliability and maintenance levels, we've winnowed our OSS offerings at Zalando to make our highest-quality work more discoverable and user-friendly. If your organization is facing GitHub-bloat challenges, looking for ways to manage your repos more effectively, or wondering how better docs can help your OSS efforts succeed, you might find some help here.</p>

    <p>Nearly everyone agrees that good documentation is important to the success of software projects, and yet very few projects actually have good documentation. Even successful projects often have barely adequate documentation.</p>
    <p>Often, it’s not for want of effort - the project’s developers have worked hard on it - nor for lack of documentation - the authors have produced a lot of it.</p>
    <p>It simply turns out to be not very good - not helpful enough for the users who should be able to rely on it, and a depressing chore for the authors who have to maintain it.</p>
    <p>The good news is that both these problems can be solved by understanding how documentation works, and that there are four distinct kinds of documentation - with four distinct functions. The four kinds of documentation are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>learning-oriented tutorials</li>
    <li>goal-oriented how-to guides</li>
    <li>understanding-oriented discussions</li>
    <li>information-oriented reference material</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Structuring documentation according to its four distinct functions helps ensure that each of them is adequately served. It also makes it far easier to write and maintain.</p>
    <p>Using real-life examples I’ll draw out the key functions of documentation, and how they map onto different ways of writing it. Putting this into practice is simple when armed with some basic guidelines. The benefits are huge, and available with a minimum of effort.</p>
    <p>I won’t be discussing documentation tools or software or other topics that have been covered amply elsewhere, but some neglected and poorly-understood aspects of documentation that will make your software projects and teams more successful.</p>

    <p>You've heard about diversity problems in tech, right? We know the problem exists at every point in the process: education, internship opportunities, hiring. We don't talk much about what happens to the people we <em>do</em> work with. </p>
    <p>As documentarians, we spend a lot of time thinking about the best words to use for our products, tutorials, manuals. We know that words matter. "Microaggressions" are the small indignities that people of color, non-cis-gendered folks, women, and others experience on a daily basis. Microaggressions at work tell us, over and over, that we don't really belong in that workplace. So let's talk about the words we use with our coworkers. Let's talk about how we can all make diversity a daily practice at work, not just a hiring problem.</p>

    <p>Free software projects, community-oriented online services and grassroots technological organizations often rely on volunteer-based documentation, both as regards writing end-user guides and localization. This can produce inconsistencies in style and approaches and, in the end, compromise the usability of the tools or services described in the documentation. There are solutions, like publishing guidelines, enabling volunteer contributions only through git pull requests, or hiring coordinators and reviewers.</p>
    <p>During this discussion, we will exchange reflections and tips on the best practices for volunteer-based documentation, so as to start a conversation on how to improve this process in free software projects and in efforts that rely on limited funds but on a strong community of eager volunteers.</p>
    <p>Depending on the number of participants, the discussion can take place in one group or be split in smaller groups that will refer to the other participants during the last 10 minutes of the discussion.</p>

  abstract: "<p>This presentation explores the evolution of language in technical
    documentation. </p>\n<p>The reign of the long-form narrative in tech docs is long
    gone. Nobody wants to read a 600 page user manual cover to cover before using
    an application or API. Users crave bite-size chunks of information, and they want
    them exactly at the point of need. They want just enough information to complete
    their task and not one conjunction more. In other words, users want high-calorie
    nutrient-dense documentation, and they want it fast.</p>\n<p>To satisfy users,
    we documentarians embrace minimalism and topic-based architectures such as DITA.
    We organize content by type: task, concept, reference, etc. We use active voice.
    We keep sentences short. And consciously or not, we’ve begun to challenge time-honored
    tech writing traditions, such as prohibitions on future tense, contractions, idioms,
    and colloquialisms – at least in American English documentation. </p>\n<p>What’s
    more, it’s no longer enough for docs to be technically accurate. They must also
    use contemporary themes familiar to users and, whenever possible, humor. Exhibit
    one is this Google Chrome error:</p>\n<p>“Aw Snap! Something went wrong while
    displaying this webpage.”</p>\n<p>And the folks at ReadMe.io used this line to
    describe a Delete button in their interface (from the 2007 film, Juno):</p>\n<p>“This
    is one doodle that can’t be undid, homeskillet.”</p>\n<p>Without question, the
    language we use in technical documentation is changing. Contractions, idioms,
    and colloquialisms, which were once banned as potentially confusing to translators,
    are now commonplace, and we use them to make our docs sound friendlier. Jargon
    abounds, the word “please” is no longer taboo, and exclamation points are not
    only allowed, they’re encouraged! They show enthusiasm for the subject!!</p>\n<p>In
    this presentation, we’ll mine the docosphere for current trends, innovations,
    and answers to these questions: \n•   How has the language in tech docs evolved
    over the past decade, and where is it headed?\n•   What are the minimum daily
    requirements for language in this brave new world: Correct grammar, complete sentences,
    parallel construction, proper word choice, clarity, brevity?\n•   What is the
    role of humor in tech docs?\n•   Is OK to for tech docs to use colloquialisms,
    idioms, contractions, and even emojis? \n•   What are the implications of this
    evolution on localization? </p>"

    <p>The usual way of writing a technical book is to open the Word or LibreOffice application, to write some content, to make a backup, to send it by email to the publisher and to deal with the feedbacks. And repeat.</p>
    <p>However in 2017 we can do differently by using open formats like Asciidoc, by using version control to propagate changes, by using collaborative platforms like GitHub or GitLab to collate feedbacks in any form as well as transforming text and code into readable and interactive artefacts.</p>
    <p>It gives us a unique opportunity to approach the whole process of writing in term of "content experience", of "toolchain" and of "distribution".</p>
    <p>In the end, a "book" becomes a "writing format" as we can reuse the same pattern to manage any kind of "content" — articles, publications, essays, documentation — that we can transform in physical books, e-books, interactive web pages etc.</p>

    requirements it satisfies. Typical requirements revolve around target audience,
    method of delivery, technical limitations. But after the doc is done, then come
    unexpected expectations. John - your key stakeholder - dislikes chiches like corporate
    templates and wants to stand out with neat Apple-styled docs. Also, it was a mistake
    to tell him about similar 'really cool docs' you already did for his colleague
    Jane because apparently they don't get along well, and now he proudly decided
    that his product is so much better that hers that it doesn't need docs at all...
    Suddenly, your docs should not only make users happy, but also help your stakeholders
    achieve their aims - move up a career ladder, impress the boss, get a bigger paycheck.

    <p>In this presentation I will explore other ways to communicate concepts beyond words to show that documentation needn't just be about technical writing.</p>
    <p>In the first part of the presentation I will briefly cover theories and principles behind forms of communication and what documentarians can learn from them. Topics such as:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Portraying meaning in images</strong>: Iconography, maps, manuals</li>
    <li><strong>Non-verbal conversation</strong>: Body language, ways of speaking</li>
    <li><strong>Fidelity</strong>: Sketch notes, simplicity, style</li>
    </ul>
    <p>During each of these topics I will present in the style of the topic, so expect something a little different.</p>
    <p>In the second practical part of the presentation I will take elements of the theory and applying them practically. I will start by looking at screenshots and diagrams. When and how to use them, what they should show, and how to manage them.</p>
    <p>Then I'll cover taking screenshots to the next level with animated gifs and screen recordings that show clear user flows and expected results.</p>
    <p>Finally in this part of the presentation I will cover interactive documentation, and the options for allowing readers to directly manipulate and experiment with documentation and directly see inputs and outputs.</p>
    <p>In summary, our work typically appears on one of the most dynamic platforms (the web) that has ever existed, let's all do more with it!</p>

    <p>For 22+ years, I am working in IT – most of this time in the “business-related” part of the game. Roughly a year ago, I decided to change something. Well – still working in IT, and still working in the same company …  But I moved from a Product Marketing role (which I hold for about 17 years) to R&amp;D, because the documentation team “made me an offer I couldn’t refuse”. </p>
    <p>Of course I interacted with many of our engineers before, and of course I also knew most of the documentation team members before. But in retrospective, I can say that I somehow lived on “another planet” before, and that my first year as documentarian in an open source software company was definitely deeply eye-opening for me. </p>

    <p>When starting a new project, developers, myself included, usually get right into hacking things, like tinkering with libraries, that we would like to learn or solving a particular problem as quickly a possible. Occasionally we also decide to publish the resulting project to a software repository such as PyPI for Python or NPM for Node.js etc., so that others can use our nifty code, submit a pull request and maybe even form a community around the project.</p>
    <p>As the creator, you might be lucky and someone will find your project on the front-page of GitHub or maybe eben Hacker News or Reddit. What happens next is on you really. But what does that mean?</p>
    <p>Before jumping right to the command line and installing your package, those who are interested usually try to find out what problems the project is solving and how it can help them with their own. That's what your README file is for - it's most likely the first thing potential users read, that you control.</p>
    <p>A good README briefly and concisely explains what your software does, how it can be installed and what API it exposes. You also want to provide information on the requirements, the license it uses and how the project is managed. Who are you? How to get in touch to report problems and give feedback? Where can potential users find the Code of Conduct for your project?</p>
    <p>This talk is for everyone who is interested in working on open source projects and wants to know how documentation can help newcomers and more experienced users use your code and to encourage them to engage in the community.</p>

Sometimes, it feels like your reviewers have a deep and abiding interest in pain. You’ll never succeed! Well, you have already succeeded just by asking for feedback.  Together, we’ll discuss how to build up your tolerance for taking that feedback.</p>
