        \ our storytelling. And I'll talk about how focusing on higher-quality docs\
        \ has helped us to instill a stronger product mindset in our development teams.\
        \ Writing a README, for example, offers an opportunity to tell the world why\
        \ a project exists, how it works (and why), what makes it unique, and how\
        \ it might evolve over time. I'll discuss how this process not only empowers\

        \ news is that both these problems can be solved by understanding how documentation\
        \ works, and that there are four distinct kinds of documentation - with four\
        \ distinct functions. The four kinds of documentation are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>learning-oriented\

        through motivation and a pinch of automation
    year: 2017
-   abstract: "<p>This presentation explores the evolution of language in technical\
        \ documentation. </p>\n<p>The reign of the long-form narrative in tech docs\
        \ is long gone. Nobody wants to read a 600 page user manual cover to cover\
        \ before using an application or API. Users crave bite-size chunks of information,\
        \ and they want them exactly at the point of need. They want just enough information\
        \ to complete their task and not one conjunction more. In other words, users\
        \ want high-calorie nutrient-dense documentation, and they want it fast.</p>\n\
        <p>To satisfy users, we documentarians embrace minimalism and topic-based\
        \ architectures such as DITA. We organize content by type: task, concept,\
        \ reference, etc. We use active voice. We keep sentences short. And consciously\
        \ or not, we\u2019ve begun to challenge time-honored tech writing traditions,\
        \ such as prohibitions on future tense, contractions, idioms, and colloquialisms\
        \ \u2013 at least in American English documentation. </p>\n<p>What\u2019s\
        \ more, it\u2019s no longer enough for docs to be technically accurate. They\
        \ must also use contemporary themes familiar to users and, whenever possible,\
        \ humor. Exhibit one is this Google Chrome error:</p>\n<p>\u201CAw Snap! Something\
        \ went wrong while displaying this webpage.\u201D</p>\n<p>And the folks at\
        \ ReadMe.io used this line to describe a Delete button in their interface\
        \ (from the 2007 film, Juno):</p>\n<p>\u201CThis is one doodle that can\u2019\
        t be undid, homeskillet.\u201D</p>\n<p>Without question, the language we use\
        \ in technical documentation is changing. Contractions, idioms, and colloquialisms,\
        \ which were once banned as potentially confusing to translators, are now\
        \ commonplace, and we use them to make our docs sound friendlier. Jargon abounds,\
        \ the word \u201Cplease\u201D is no longer taboo, and exclamation points are\
        \ not only allowed, they\u2019re encouraged! They show enthusiasm for the\
        \ subject!!</p>\n<p>In this presentation, we\u2019ll mine the docosphere for\
        \ current trends, innovations, and answers to these questions: \n\u2022  \
        \ How has the language in tech docs evolved over the past decade, and where\
        \ is it headed?\n\u2022   What are the minimum daily requirements for language\
        \ in this brave new world: Correct grammar, complete sentences, parallel construction,\
        \ proper word choice, clarity, brevity?\n\u2022   What is the role of humor\
        \ in tech docs?\n\u2022   Is it OK for tech docs to use colloquialisms, idioms,\
        \ contractions, and even emojis? \n\u2022   What are the implications of this\
        \ evolution on localization? </p>"

        from them. Topics such as:</p>

        <ul>

        <li><p>Portraying meaning in images: Iconography, maps, manuals</p></li>

        <li><p>Non-verbal conversation: Body language, ways of speaking</p></li>

        <li><p>Fidelity: Sketch notes, simplicity, style</p></li>

        </ul>

        <p>During each of these topics I will present in the style of the topic, so
        expect something a little different.</p>

        <p>In the second practical part of the presentation I will take elements of
        the theory and applying them practically. I will start by looking at screenshots
        and diagrams. When and how to use them, what they should show, and how to
        manage them.</p>

        <p>Then I''ll cover taking screenshots to the next level with animated gifs
        and screen recordings that show clear user flows and expected results.</p>

        <p>Finally in this part of the presentation I will cover interactive documentation,
        and the options for allowing readers to directly manipulate and experiment
        with documentation and directly see inputs and outputs.</p>

        <p>In summary, our work typically appears on one of the most dynamic platforms
        (the web) that has ever existed, let''s all do more with it!</p>'

        \ to change something. Well \u2013 still working in IT, and still working\
        \ in the same company \u2026  But I moved from a Product Marketing role (which\
        \ I hold for about 17 years) to R&amp;D, because the documentation team \u201C\
        made me an offer I couldn\u2019t refuse\u201D. </p>\n<p>Of course I interacted\
        \ with many of our engineers before, and of course I also knew most of the\
        \ documentation team members before. But in retrospective, I can say that\
        \ I somehow lived on \u201Canother planet\u201D before, and that my first\
        \ year as documentarian in an open source software company was definitely\
        \ deeply eye-opening for me. </p>\n<p>If you are curious now, join the talk\

        <p>Using examples from our work with iNERDE, a social enterprise seeking to
        empower West African youth with Science, Technology, Engineering and Math

-   abstract: '<p>When starting a new project, developers, myself included, usually
        get right into hacking things, like tinkering with libraries, that we would
        like to learn or solving a particular problem as quickly a possible. Occasionally
        we also decide to publish the resulting project to a software repository such
        as PyPI for Python or NPM for Node.js etc., so that others can use our nifty
        code, submit a pull request and maybe even form a community around the project.</p>

        <p>As the creator, you might be lucky and someone will find your project on
        the front-page of GitHub or maybe eben Hacker News or Reddit. What happens
        next is on you really. But what does that mean?</p>

        <p>Before jumping right to the command line and installing your package, those
        who are interested usually try to find out what problems the project is solving
        and how it can help them with their own. That''s what your README file is
        for - it''s most likely the first thing potential users read, that you control.</p>

        <p>A good README briefly and concisely explains what your software does, how
        it can be installed and what API it exposes. You also want to provide information
        on the requirements, the license it uses and how the project is managed. Who
        are you? How to get in touch to report problems and give feedback? Where can
        potential users find the Code of Conduct for your project?</p>

        <p>This talk is for everyone who is interested in working on open source projects
        and wants to know how documentation can help newcomers and more experienced
        users use your code and to encourage them to engage in the community.</p>'

-   abstract: '<p>Crowdsourcing is an increasingly attractive practice that is being
        used to develop documentation. When well designed, this approach increases
        documentation velocity and reduces bottlenecks. However, there are (at least)
        two huge challenges:</p>

        <ul>

        <li><p>Keeping documentation quality high</p></li>

        <li><p>Ensuring that content gets developed in line with the products and

        <p>While no doc set will ever be perfect, there is hope for overcoming these
        challenges. In this talk, I''ll share lessons learned from working through
        these challenges at companies of various sizes. We''ll walk through content
        management best practices, including: </p>

        <ul>

        <li><p>Setting occasional authors up for success</p></li>
