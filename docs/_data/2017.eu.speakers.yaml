    motivation and a pinch of automation
- abstract: "<p>This presentation explores the evolution of language in technical\
    \ documentation. </p>\n<p>The reign of the long-form narrative in tech docs is\
    \ long gone. Nobody wants to read a 600 page user manual cover to cover before\
    \ using an application or API. Users crave bite-size chunks of information, and\
    \ they want them exactly at the point of need. They want just enough information\
    \ to complete their task and not one conjunction more. In other words, users want\
    \ high-calorie nutrient-dense documentation, and they want it fast.</p>\n<p>To\
    \ satisfy users, we documentarians embrace minimalism and topic-based architectures\
    \ such as DITA. We organize content by type: task, concept, reference, etc. We\
    \ use active voice. We keep sentences short. And consciously or not, we\u2019\
    ve begun to challenge time-honored tech writing traditions, such as prohibitions\
    \ on future tense, contractions, idioms, and colloquialisms \u2013 at least in\
    \ American English documentation. </p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, it\u2019s no longer\
    \ enough for docs to be technically accurate. They must also use contemporary\
    \ themes familiar to users and, whenever possible, humor. Exhibit one is this\
    \ Google Chrome error:</p>\n<p>\u201CAw Snap! Something went wrong while displaying\
    \ this webpage.\u201D</p>\n<p>And the folks at ReadMe.io used this line to describe\
    \ a Delete button in their interface (from the 2007 film, Juno):</p>\n<p>\u201C\
    This is one doodle that can\u2019t be undid, homeskillet.\u201D</p>\n<p>Without\
    \ question, the language we use in technical documentation is changing. Contractions,\
    \ idioms, and colloquialisms, which were once banned as potentially confusing\
    \ to translators, are now commonplace, and we use them to make our docs sound\
    \ friendlier. Jargon abounds, the word \u201Cplease\u201D is no longer taboo,\
    \ and exclamation points are not only allowed, they\u2019re encouraged! They show\
    \ enthusiasm for the subject!!</p>\n<p>In this presentation, we\u2019ll mine the\
    \ docosphere for current trends, innovations, and answers to these questions:\
    \ \n\u2022   How has the language in tech docs evolved over the past decade, and\
    \ where is it headed?\n\u2022   What are the minimum daily requirements for language\
    \ in this brave new world: Correct grammar, complete sentences, parallel construction,\
    \ proper word choice, clarity, brevity?\n\u2022   What is the role of humor in\
    \ tech docs?\n\u2022   Is OK to for tech docs to use colloquialisms, idioms, contractions,\
    \ and even emojis? \n\u2022   What are the implications of this evolution on localization?\

- abstract: <p>Any doc - every doc - that you deliver, it's only as useful as the
    requirements it satisfies. Typical requirements revolve around target audience,
    method of delivery, technical limitations. But after the doc is done, then come
    unexpected expectations. John - your key stakeholder - dislikes chiches like corporate
    templates and wants to stand out with neat Apple-styled docs. Also, it was a mistake
    to tell him about similar 'really cool docs' you already did for his colleague
    Jane because apparently they don't get along well, and now he proudly decided
    that his product is so much better that hers that it doesn't need docs at all...
    Suddenly, your docs should not only make users happy, but also help your stakeholders
    achieve their aims - move up a career ladder, impress the boss, get a bigger paycheck.
    The success of your docs depends on things you are never told. This talk is about

    <p>In the first part of the presentation I will briefly cover theories and principles
    behind forms of communication and what documentarians can learn from them. Topics
    such as:</p>

    <ul>

    <li><strong>Portraying meaning in images</strong>: Iconography, maps, manuals</li>

    <li><strong>Non-verbal conversation</strong>: Body language, ways of speaking</li>

    <li><strong>Fidelity</strong>: Sketch notes, simplicity, style</li>

    </ul>

    <p>During each of these topics I will present in the style of the topic, so expect
    something a little different.</p>

    <p>In the second practical part of the presentation I will take elements of the
    theory and applying them practically. I will start by looking at screenshots and
    diagrams. When and how to use them, what they should show, and how to manage them.</p>

    <p>Then I''ll cover taking screenshots to the next level with animated gifs and
    screen recordings that show clear user flows and expected results.</p>

    <p>Finally in this part of the presentation I will cover interactive documentation,
    and the options for allowing readers to directly manipulate and experiment with
    documentation and directly see inputs and outputs.</p>
