-   abstract: '<p>What is a documentation structure, and why does it matter to developers?</p>

        <p>Lots of developers get asked to write their own documentation, especially

        internal documentation and onboarding. In theory, this is good because they

        know the problems they are writing about and don''t need to spend time explaining

        them. In practice, developers avoid this work because they don''t have a good

        idea of how to start and can''t evaluate whether they have succeeded.</p>
        <p>This

        workshop is designed to teach you a few basic theories of technical documentation,

        such as task-based topics, reusable content, and writing for an audience.
        After

        the overview, you''ll learn techniques for writing bug reports, error messages,

        and onboarding instructions in a tool-agnostic, repeatable way. You''ll leave

        this workshop with a handful of techniques, templates, and tests that will
        improve

        your team''s communication and your life as a developer.</p> <ul> <li><p>What

        is structure?</p></li> <li><p>What do I really need to know?</p></li> <li><p>How

        to write an error message</p></li> <li><p>How to write a bug report</p></li>

        <li><p>What is transparent to writers?</p></li> <li><p>How do you interact
        with

        the team around building stuff.</p></li> </ul> <p>The structure will be 60-90

        minutes for basics, and then the rest for workshops.</p><p>Tickets to this

        editing the work of others than writing ourselves. When you have a large team

        or a large product (or both!), the cooks in the documentation kitchen come
        from

        all parts of the company: marketing, product, engineering, sales, and more.
        This

        adds a significant burden on you and your team to make sure the content they
        produce

        is accurate, fits within your style guide, uses the correct tone, and doesn''''t

        add additional confusion.</p><p>At Mapbox, we have both a large team and a
        complex

        product, which means many different writers with individual writing styles
        and

        varying depth of knowledge of the product. To keep our work accurate and unified

        under a common voice while avoiding breaking our necks with editing, we implemented

        an automated content testing system (fully open source!) to do some of the
        work

        for us. Automated tests have helped us embed quality writing and editing into

        the development process as much as code testing does. &quot;It''''s not finished

        until it''''s documented&quot; is more than just a happy thought -- it''''s
        now an

        immovable part of our workflow.</p><p>In this talk, I will discuss the reasons

        you might want to implement an automated testing system in your organization,

        examples of how it''''s been beneficial, the story of how we set up our system,

        and a brief overview of the tools that exist for doing this work. I''''ll
        also cover

        the ways that automated tests can sometimes make funny mistakes and how we
        found

        the balance between making tests too precise and not precise enough. For those

        who are interested in implementing right away, I will also provide a comprehensive

        list of resources for getting started.</p>

        by the lack of available information as to what that really means and how
        exactly

        you''re supposed to do it? Welcome to the club!</p><p>&quot;Treating documentation

        like code&quot; is somewhat of a buzzword bingo term these days. You can find

        any number of blog posts, presentations, and articles online expounding on
        the

        theory and merits of the idea. When I was presented with an opportunity to
        truly

        integrate documentation into the agile development process almost 2 years
        ago,

        I couldn''t find any information that could teach me how to treat docs like

        code. Since then, I''ve worked with a team of passionate software engineers
        to

        bring a long list of ''awesome-future'' ideas for treating documentation like

        code into practice. In this presentation, I''ll lay out how we create, test,

        build, and publish our documentation using agile methodologies, so others
        starting

        down the same road have a path to follow.</p><p>In the beginning, we had a
        great

        idea - documentation should be developed, tested, and built just like the
        products

        we make. The keystone of this grand vision was the idea that docs live in
        the

        same repositories as the code, use the same development tools and code review

        processes, and follow a continuous delivery model. I''ll go over the tools
        we

        chose to write, build, and test the docs; the responsibilities of the software

        engineers and technical writer, respectively, for creating and maintaining
        content;

        the docs information architecture we developed; how we incorporated syntax
        and

        grammar checks into code testing; and how we build and deploy our documentation

        automatically.</p>

        journalism all day long, writing their own docs often falls by the wayside.
        News

        deadlines can leave little time for cleanup and documentation (much less the
        planning

        that leads to reusable code). At OpenNews, these developers, designers, and
        data

        analysts are our community, and we designed a series of small events to address

        that time crunch. We bring people together a few times a year to refine, document,

        and release open-source projects, because a common set of tools means more
        time

        spent covering the news, less time on recreating code.</p><p>During these
        events,

        we''''ve seen a common set of cultural and technical questions come up before,
        during,

        and after projects--but our community didn''''t have a common pool of answers.</p><p>So

        last year, we did something about it. Inspired by collaborative book-writing
        projects,

        we put together a community documentation sprint in December 2016. The goal:
        to

        draft a guidebook for releasing newsroom code. Over two intensive days, 11
        contributors

        gathered with us in Washington, D.C., and another dozen signed on as remote
        editors.

        Together, they captured our community''''s best practices for open-sourcing
        software,

        specifically in the context of newsrooms and journalism. They worked in pairs

        or small groups, clustered around laptops, collaborating for long stretches
        of

        writing. We fed them many snacks.</p><p>The Field Guide to Open Source in
        the

        Newsroom launched in February, and we learned a lot as it came together. We''''d

        love to tell you:</p><ul><li><p>How we recruited and prepared a diverse, expert

        team of participants for a productive event</p></li><li><p>How we ran the
        two-day

        documentation sprint, with a flexible, supportive structure</p></li><li><p>How

        we built in time for followthrough after the event, with plans for outreach,
        adoption

        and onboarding</p></li><li><p>And how we made the whole thing human-friendly</p></li></ul></p>

        choosing flavors of LaCroix sparkling water for the Red Hat breakroom have\
        \ to\ndo with improving technical documentation? At Red Hat, everything. </p><p>You\n\
        see, when we wanted to make a culture shift in our approach to documentation,\n\
        we couldn't legislate the change from the top down. Managers and experts\n\
        just don't have that kind of authority at Red Hat. Changing the way we\nwrite\
        \ has had to be a grassroots, bottom-up effort. Just like we all get to\n\
        vote on which flavors of sparkling water and other beverages are stocked in\n\
        our fridge, writers, editors, content strategists, and managers ALL have a\
        \ say\nin our latest writing trends. At Red Hat, we have an open culture where\
        \ people\nexpect to have a voice in decisions and aren't afraid to speak their\
        \ minds.\nThis open culture affects every aspect of our working lives.</p><p>What\
        \ Did\nWe Want to Change? We wanted to introduce our teams to minimalist writing.\n\
        But first we had to convince people that minimalism isn't just about shorter\n\
        sentences and less fluffy documentation. Minimalist writing means that you\
        \ focus\nlike a laser on just what your customers need at the moment. It's\
        \ harder\nthan it sounds. </p><p>How Did We Do It?First, we formed an international\n\
        team that could influence writers across all our geographical regions (geos).\n\
        Brice Fallon-Freeman (from Australia), Aneta Petrov\xE1 (from the Czech Republic),\n\
        and I (from the US) became this team and brainstormed ways to introduce these\n\
        concepts to our departments. </p><p>Aneta and Brice came up with the idea\n\
        of crowdsourcing minimalist writing critiques, and all three of us tried the\n\
        concept in our different geos. We got volunteers to join our groups, and then\n\
        we got more volunteers who were willing to have their content critiqued. This\n\
        \u201Ccrowd\u201D of writers and editors then worked together to give meaningful\n\
        feedback to the people who had been brave enough to volunteer their content.\n\
        </p><p>The beauty of this model is that it gives experienced writers a way\n\
        to teach more junior writers without the process being apparent. No one has\n\
        to admit to being ignorant. Inexperienced writers get to learn about minimalism\n\
        by watching other people apply it to real content and not in some kind of\
        \ fake\ntraining situation. </p><p>This talk will discuss our strategies and\
        \ methods\nin more detail and show examples of content before and after crowdsourced\
        \ minimalism.</p>\n"

        \ on\nour platform.</p><p>Overwhelmingly, the responses included complaints\
        \ about\nconfusing site navigation and frustration around having to search\
        \ multiple pages\nto string together the necessary information to implement\
        \ features. After considering\nthis feedback, we redesigned the documentation\
        \ site to focus on information\nneeded to complete a desired task, and while\
        \ we still provide endpoint reference\ndocumentation, my focus now is to start\
        \ from thinking about what a developer\nis trying to accomplish, rather than\
        \ what data an endpoint is capable of providing.\nEssentially, the focus of\
        \ the docs shifted away from what the API can do, towards\nwhat \u201CI\u201D\
        , as the developer, can do with this API.</p><p>Taking a task-oriented\napproach\
        \ allowed us to reorganize and revise our content in a way that has significantly\n\
        shortened our onboarding process for partner developers, shortening the app\n\
        verification process and time-to-market, and most importantly allows us to\
        \ better\ncollaborate with our partners to develop exciting new experiences\
        \ for NPR listeners.\nFor those who work on documenting hypermedia APIs, this\
        \ can be a particularly\nuseful approach, since these services tend to have\
        \ fewer specific endpoints,\nand the documentation needs to focus much more\
        \ on how the client can successfully\nnavigate links to accomplish the desired\
        \ task. In this 30-minute talk, I'\nll discuss how you can successfully integrate\
        \ this approach to your workflow\nwhen considering everything from overall\

-   abstract: '<p>This talk is about the verifiability crisis in science, politics,

        and technology, and how methods developed to address verifiablity in statistical

        publishing can be adapted to other areas such as technical writing.</p><ul>

        <li><p>In 2015, a group of researchers set out to replicate the results  obtained

        in a set of 100 published psychology research papers. It  turned out that

        only 29 out of the 100 could be replicated. </p></li><li><p>In the 2016 elections,

        so-called "fake news"--fabricated news  published on venues such as Facebook--influenced

        many voters in their  choice of candidates.</p></li><li><p>In the field

        of technical writing, it is not uncommon to discover that  technical documentation

        is inaccurate. Although the docs might have  been accurate when first published,

        the underlying technology evolved  rendering the docs obsolete. </p></li>

        </ul><p>Academic, public-policy, and business decisions are sometimes made
        after

        accepting published (mis)information at face value. The costs can beconsiderable.</p>

        <p>The information often arrives in the form of an electronic document, such
        as

        a web page or PDF file. To verify the information, someone has to "fact check"

        it.  But what if the document could, in some sense, "speakfor itself" and

        demonstrate the veracity of what it is saying?</p><p>In response to the verifiability

        crisis in science, statisticians havedeveloped technology to create "intelligent

        documents" that not onlyreport the results of a statistical analysis, but

        can also re-create theanalysis itself.</p>

-   abstract: '<p>Come along on a tour of common types of documentation system administrators

        use to get their jobs done.</p><p>As an enterprise software developer, system

        administrators are my customers and colleagues. In this session, learn not
        just

        what gets used, but also what internal and informal sources to look for to
        create

        better docs. I''ll share what I''ve learned sysadmins want from the written
        information

        they rely on daily. I''ll also talk about what ops teams write for themselves

        that can add important details to your documents.</p><p>We''ll go beyond

        glossy presentation slides of instructor-led training to delve into what''s

        meaningful for day-to-day tasks. For example, integration and migration: to

        accomplish this smoothly, sysadmins need references and examples to install,

        configure, and customize new tools to work with existing systems. Tutorials

        can show how, real-world configuration examples show what, and cookbooks provide

        ready-made examples to customize as needed. Deployment checklists ensure the

        rollout goes smoothly.</p><p>Emergencies can happen at any hour\u2014which

        is why runbooks can be so valuable. With step-by-step details so staff can
        respond

        without making mistakes. A junior engineer can resolve an issue without calling

        a developer for help. Manifests, dependency lists, and logs become necessary

        adjuncts to documentation, providing critical data for root cause analysis.</p><p>Learn

        about these sources, not just how others use them, but where you can find
        valuable

        detail to enhance the documents you write for operations.</p>
