  abstract: '<p>Tyler was diagnosed with ADHD at 27 years old; 3 years later, and
    having moved from a reactive Technical Support position into a creative and proactive
    Technical Writing position, he discovered many ways in which his ADHD interacts
    with his creative process. When comparing with other Technical Writers, especially
    those who are “neuro-typical”, he noticed that his productivity levels were significantly
    impacted - whilst other people put out a steady stream of work over time, he found
    that he spent a lot of time ruminating over details and research before a massive
    spike in productivity where all of the “measurable” metrics would spike too.</p>

    <p>Realizing that this was significant, he took this thought process to a group
    of colleagues who identify as neuro-diverse, and to his surprise, many of them
    identified heavily with the situation and the attached feelings. He explored them
    with those colleagues, as well as several other trusted people, and he would like
    to share the findings with you.</p>

    <p>Come and explore this topic with Tyler, where he’ll aim to help your understanding
    of:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>The impact of ADHD on the creative writing process</li>

    <li>Differences in the “neuro-typical” writing process and the “neuro-diverse”

    <li>Managing an ADHD writer</li>

    <li>How to view measurable metrics in a supportive manner for ADHD employees</li>

  abstract: '<p>There are many times in your career as a technical writer or documentarian
    where you may feel restricted on your communications with members of other teams.
    Particularly when dealing with the more technical teammates, subject matter experts,
    and co-founders who carry knowledge in their minds that needs documented, asking
    questions can be daunting. What is the best method to use to interact with this
    person? When is the best time? Will they even respond? If they don’t respond,
    should you push harder? This can be discouraging and turn you away from inquisitiveness,
    and doubly so if you are by nature a quiet or introverted person.</p>

    <p>This is often true to such an extent that writers will apologize for asking
    questions. This leads into the crux of the matter, which is this: Never apologize
    for asking questions. Never apologize for being curious. And never apologize for
    doing your job. Curiosity is one of the greatest qualities a documentarian can
    have. Anecdotally, I just hired two technical writers for our documentation team,
    and one of the qualities I and other interviewers were screening for was just
    this. What questions do they ask? Are they inquisitive? Do they take on new subjects
    to learn because they want to? Are they comfortable documenting things they’re
    unfamiliar with before starting?</p>

    <p>You should never be worried about or discouraged from asking questions. If
    you’re not in the mental space to be comfortable with this part of your job, it’s
    an easy enough habit to pick up, and it’s a critical part of documenting anything.
    There are of course times when you can read about what you need, and simply rephrase
    and organize existing information. That’s useful for the presentation of disorganized
    information, but when you are tasked with documenting something new, questions
    are essential. The people providing you with raw information, no matter how familiar
    with the product or feature, often do not know everything that the customer, and
    by proxy, you, will need to know to use it. That’s your job — that’s why you’re
    being paid — to be the expert in generating, crafting, and refining the documentation.
    Don’t sell yourself short.</p>

    <p>In this talk I’ll cover the above points in more detail, provide some clear
    real world examples, and discuss how to take into account things like domain knowledge,
    egos, internal politics, and more while still gathering the information you need
    to do your work. It’s your job as a documentarian to ask the questions the customer
    may not be able to ask easily, so that you can answer them yourself!</p>'

  abstract: '<p>Documentation and marketing are often considered as diametrically
    opposed to each other, both in terms of their goals and methods. It is true that
    the conventions for technical and marketing content are different, and technical
    writing and marketing could both be conducted in a way that they come into conflict
    with each other. However, this does not need to be the case.</p>

    <p>In this talk, I argue that the goals of technical writing and marketing are
    aligned in many ways. Specifically, the impact that documentation aims to have
    on different user groups is closely connected to the goals of marketing. Technical
    writing aims to motivate users, help them solve their problems, and enable them
    to explore. In this understanding, documentation can effectively contribute to
    the classical marketing aims of engagement, retention and upsell. Based on this
    premise, my talk explores how documentation and marketing can collaborate with
    and learn from each other.</p>'

  abstract: '<p>In today''s busy environment, not every customer has the time to migrate

    not using a complex feature which might actually be very useful and a great revenue
    generator to the organization. </p>

    <p>In this presentation, I present a customer adoption technique by use of UI
    based help. UI based help is not the same as context sensitive help nor does it
    refer to the traditional hard-coded tooltips created by developers. UI based help
    refers to various attractive, attention grabbing methods of presenting content
    to the users on the UI itself thus negating the need to go to the documentation
    site each time they are stuck.</p>

    <p>Does that mean that the traditional style of documentation would be completely
    be replaced? certainly Not. UI based help is generally crisp and serves a specific
    purpose. For example, UI based help can be used to explain a specific field on
    the UI which could otherwise be difficult to understand, a flow which explains
    (in brief) how to use a new feature with a few clicks, an announcement (new release,
    new feature, new investor, new acquisition etc), a survey and so on.   </p>

  abstract: '<p>The Turing Way is an open-source community-led guide to reproducible,
    ethical and inclusive data science. Its goal is to provide all the information
    that researchers, industry professionals and members of the public need to understand
    reproducibility and ethical standards in data science at all stages of development.
    The Turing Way contains chapters with best practices, guidance and recommendations
    that are crowdsourced, collaboratively documented and used internationally by
    researchers from across the globe.</p>

    <p>The Turing Way community currently hosts over 200 sub-chapters across five
    guides and over 300 direct contributors on GitHub, where we develop our resources
    that are used by thousands of geographically and culturally diverse users. However,
    the guide is written in English. This language barrier motivated us to create
    community-led, multilingual versions of The Turing Way, with the same collaborative
    spirit that permeates the main guide. The community then started working collaboratively
    on translations of the Turing Way material to several languages, including Spanish,
    Arabic and Turkish, while trying out different platforms (such as Transifex and
    Crowdin).</p>

    <p>Eventually, we established a workflow in Crowdin for the translation, which
    is a key step for internationalisation (i18n) of The Turing Way. Localisation
    (l10n) and internationalisation (i18n) are important aspects in the design of
    any open-source project or document. Internationalisation allows open-source projects
    to support and satisfy the needs of multiple locales, thus “enabling” localisation,
    which is the adaptation of it to meet the language and the culture of a specific
    target locale.</p>

    <p>However, translation workflows can often become confusing and inconsistent,
    and many translation efforts go unfinished for several different reasons. Our
    aim is to provide clear guidelines so any potential contributor is able to participate
    freely while keeping consistency in the translation. We project clear documentation
    to facilitate the creation of language bridges that connect to diverse audiences.
    Therefore, we have documented the translation workflows inside the Community Handbook,
    which is a part of the Turing Way book. It provides information about all our
    practices within the project, ways of working, and other aspects that can make
    community participation equitable for all members. We also include language-specific
    documentation in GitHub written by the target language contributors. By structuring
    and combining the relevant glossaries available in such languages, we enable community
    members to consistently translate using standardised terminology.  Sharing and
    documenting our translation journey has proven to be important in reaching out
    to new members and making their contributions smoother and more accessible.</p>'
