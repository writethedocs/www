  abstract: '<p>For nearly six years, my involvement in documentation across various
    startups has revealed common challenges. In the early stages, developers, not
    well-versed in documentation best practices, handle the task. To shape it effectively,
    they bring in junior writers, creating a cycle of frustration. Writers become
    uncertain about meeting user needs, and developers attempt various solutions,
    often resulting in customer complaints, keeping documentation a significant problem.</p>

    <p>To address this, companies often bring in managers from other areas of the
    organization, even if lacking documentation experience, to lead the documentation
    team. However, this manager''s lack of experience can unintentionally hinder providing
    writers with the right tools, keeping documentation as a pain point. This manager
    must also communicate with other stakeholders upset with documentation quality
    and show empathy. That is the starting point, and the journey after that is challenging
    and intense, pushing me to create a plan to align documentation with the product''s
    plan.</p>

    <p>My story is about understanding startup struggles where developers manage documentation
    and helping them create a plan.</p>

    <p>In this session, I''ll share a strategic approach to transform startup documentation
    into a valuable asset. I''ll guide you on treating documentation as a product,
    aligning it with the product roadmap and strategy, and providing practical steps
    at each phase. Another essential aspect I''ll cover is implementing clear guidelines
    and processes, emphasizing a data-driven approach highlighted by surveys to identify
    pain points. Throughout the session, you''ll learn how to create prototypes for
    incremental changes and explore the power of A/B testing to secure organization-wide
    buy-in. Beyond fixing content, this session serves as a practical toolkit, simplifying
    the intricacies of startup documentation and providing essential strategies for
    scaling success.</p>

    <p>Key Takeaways:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Navigate documentation challenges in startup environments through a structured,
    phased approach.</li>

    <li>Strategies for seamlessly integrating documentation into the overall product
    roadmap.</li>

    While our docs were thorough, I found them dense, detailed, and difficult to parse.
    They needed reorganization, a new navigation layer, and a lighter touch.</p>

    <p>Technical documentation should not be boring or opaque. No one ever said, “yes,
    that documentation was thorough, but I wish it had been more bland and mind-numbing.”</p>

    <p>Over the past two years, I’ve had the opportunity to revise and enhance our
    documentation in several key ways:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Reduced cognitive load by adding white space and reinforcing graphics</li>

    <li>Created graphic representations of abstract processes</li>

    <li>Used video to illustrate background workflows</li>

    </ul>

    <p>We had several of these updates underway when my manager and I attended Write
    the Docs Portland 2023. Presentations by Caitlin Davey and Ryan Young gave us
    confidence that we were making sensible changes, and gave us the vocabulary to
    explain the rationale behind our enhancements to our stakeholders.</p>

    <p>My presentation covers:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Coordinating with visual designers to create a corporate graphic style</li>

    the Internet: Is engineering required for technical writing? Do I need an Engineering
    degree to become a Technical Writer? We know the short answer is "No," and it
    is a fact that many technical writers come from different fields and non-technical
    backgrounds. But we also know that technical knowledge and a fundamental understanding
    of Engineering are advantageous for the job.</p>

    <p>I started my career as a technical writer with a Bachelor of Arts in Language
    and Literature, so I naturally asked myself those questions at some point, even
    though I learned programming many years before that. Today, I have a master''s
    degree in Applied Informatics, and I''ve been a technical writer for six years.
    During this time, I''ve dealt with many different documentation needs from customers
    of diverse industries. I''ve also learned from my fellow team members, including
    UX designers, QA, Data, SRE, and software engineers.</p>

    <p>I am still convinced that you don''t need an engineering degree to be a successful
    technical writer, but I''ve found out you can apply some basic engineering principles
    to it. In this talk, I''ll share some insights on how to apply engineering principles

    and yet is one of the most fundamental tools for creating accessible and scalable
    content.</p>

    <p>I’ve put words in a lot of different places as part of my role as a toolchain
    developer. I’ve helped math scholars get their papers published in print; I’ve
    helped build GUI tools for computer experts to streamline their writing process;
    I’ve built processes for major publishers to get best-selling novels out into
    the world as both print and ebooks simultaneously; I’ve helped technical documentation
    teams create websites, books, and whitepapers all from the same content. And there
    are a few things I’ve learned in the process:</p>

    <p>Good writing is more than good words. Good writing is easy to navigate, it
    reaches people of all levels of ability, and it retains its meaning even when
    the presentational format changes. </p>

    <p>One element that powers all of those things is good semantics. Semantics describes
    the parts of a written document: which bits are the headings?  Which paragraphs
    are body text? Which blocks are part of the main narrative, and which are asides?
    While it may seem basic, this information is crucial if you want to create content
    that can flow into streamlined workflows and reach all users, and it’s something
    that is often invisible and often overlooked.</p>

    <p>In this presentation, I’ll cover:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>A definition of semantics, in the context of writing and documentation</li>

    <li>Why are semantics good and important?</li>

    <li>The importance of differentiating semantics from visual design</li>

    <li>What strategies I have worked with when helping authors of differing technical
    backgrounds apply good semantics</li>

    <li>Who, what, when, and how: choosing a good semantic strategy for your own work
    or team, and finding the tools to support it</li>

  abstract: '<p>For API documentation, you made the decision to move to OpenAPI. OpenAPI
    is a remarkable specification and framework. It became the industry standard in
    2016. This standard provides API documentation with structure, consistency, and
    versatility. This is an important milestone in that it moves API documentation
    away from Word files, PDFs, and other unstructured formats.</p>

    <p>However, making that decision is only the initial step on a longer journey:</p>

    <ol>

    <li>New documentation, API documentation writers</li>

    <li>Documentation only, API documentation writers and developers</li>

    <li>Prototyping, API documentation writers, and program managers</li>

    <li>API-First, API documentation writers, and developers</li>

    </ol>

    <p>The complexity increases as you go down the list as do the rewards. The product
    gets more mature, and the team, more experienced. Each stage has its own set of
    challenges and different team members supporting it. The other realization is
    that API documentation is no longer a writer-only endeavor. It takes a team. </p>

    <p>In this presentation, I will share these four stages. This helps you understand
    the project in a long-term view. It also enables you manage to expectations when
    getting started. I discuss:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Why you want to follow this progression,</li>

    <li>What each stage means,</li>

    <li>What the expectations are.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>You don’t have to already be an API documentation writer. You may be interested
    or new to the field and want to know more. Neither do you have to know programming
    or a specific programming language to begin. As long as writers treat this as
    a craft, the documentation will seem to write itself.</p>'

    <p>We''ll do the easy ones first. What''s the oldest software system that you
    personally work with regularly, and what does it do? I would have to check GitHub
    dates, but at Tinder off the top of my head I''d guess our iOS purchase flow,
    and it provides features in exchange for payment tokens.</p>

    <p>Now come the upsetting ones. How does it do that, and <em>why</em> does it
    do it in that way? Answering these two would take me hours to talk through, and
    days or possibly weeks to research, and that''s assuming all of the information
    is actually available today (it''s not).</p>

    <p>Decisions about how to build software are made in environments teeming with
    context. They are influenced by factors ranging from the current financial state
    of a company to the personal preferences of the engineer(s) building them. In
    any given distributed system you may find incomplete features, abandoned migrations,
    and compromises made that have changed API contracts, but greatly eased integrations.
    Many, if not all, of these factors may be invisible once code has shipped.</p>

    <p>At Tinder some of our teams try to capture this valuable context, as well as
    share engineering standards and preserve tribal knowledge, via Software Design
    Reviews. We recently formed a Design Review Working Group to improve this process,
    as well as to make it more generally available across our engineering teams. In
    this talk I will share the findings of our research, what we ended up implementing,
    and what results it has shown in the past 12 months of general availability.</p>

    <p>Questions in this talk that others might find informative:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>How did we minimize documenter effort, while improving operational excellence,
    and optimizing for documentation that remains useful over time?</li>

    <li>How did we alter our design review documentation system to serve the needs
    of diverse, cross-functional teams?</li>

    <li>How did we build broad consensus across an engineering department with little
    cross-team structure?</li>

    written by software engineers for their colleagues – is crucial for the smooth
    functioning of a company, as can be attested to by anyone who’s been woken at
    3 AM by an automated detector that nobody seems to have explained anywhere. But
    it’s also subject to very different tradeoffs than end-user-facing documentation
    is; prototypically, you’d imagine a <em>lot</em> more docs, subject to fewer review
    cycles, written by teams with very different norms, for which a content strategy
    is <em>way</em> harder to direct from on high.</p>

    <p>The upsides of those trade-offs are very real: internal docs can make some
    simplifying assumptions about their audience, are lower-friction to edit, and
    are less constrained by a need to fit into a company-wide content strategy. Magnified
    by scale, however, the downsides of these trade-offs – like how much easier it
    becomes to let docs go stale or become fragmented – can grow into systemic sociological
    issues with internal docs culture. </p>

    <p>So, what can we as documentarians do to ensure that our internal docs overcome
    those issues and remain effective? I’ll be talking about my experience at Stripe’s
    team tasked with answering that question. Most of my talk will focus on what sociological
    issues we’ve found in our internal documentation posture (many of which we think
    are generalizable!) – ones around freshness, fragmentation, discoverability, and
    more – as well as what opinionated unique features we’ve designed into our in-house
    internal docs platform to combat those issues. We think our approach has helped
    (developer satisfaction with Stripe-internal documentation has gone way up!) and
    want to share how we’ve recognized and remediated these kinds of problems.</p>'
