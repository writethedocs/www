# Announcing Write the Docs NA 2015

We are excited to announce the dates for the 2015 conference!

* The conference will be held at the **Crystal Ballroom** in Downtown Portland.

### Conference

Join us for a three-day event to explore the art and science of documentation.
You can look forward to learning more about documentation systems, tech writing theory, information delivery, and more.
Past talks have also covered such diverse topics as typography, empathy, and [Wabi-sabi][wabisabi].

The main event takes place from May 18-19 (Monday and Tuesday) from 9am to 6pm.
We will return to the historic [Crystal Ballroom][crystal-ballroom], [centrally located](http://goo.gl/maps/D2WrJ) in the heart of Portland.

Segue, there are a wide variety auxiliary events.

### Auxiliary Events

Write the Docs is more than a conference.
Each year we organize other events so that people can get to know each other better.
This year we're expanding those activities into a full third day of fun.
These events are optional, but we strongly recommend you come into town Saturday or early Sunday to participate.

This year, those events will include:

* Hike (Saturday Afternoon) --- Enjoy the majestic beauty of Portland with this walk in the woods
* Writing Day (Sunday Daytime) --- Get together and *write the docs* with your fellow documentarians.
  This is a great opportunity to learn from others and share your knowledge.
  Document your own projects or contribute to an open-source project such as Wordpress or Mozilla Developer Network.
* Conference Reception (Sunday Night) --- Come early, get your badge, and get to know other attendees
* Official Party (Monday Night) --- Wind down and talk about the day's talks in a relaxed and friendly environment

### Keep in Touch

We will be announcing more information soon, including the call for proposals and pricing.
If you wish to receive more information as it becomes available, sign up for [our mailing list][mailing-list] or follow us on Twitter at [@writethedocs][twitter].

If you are interested in sponsorship, please [send us an email][email-us].

### Conclusion

We are excited to be part of the growing community of documentarians.
This year promises to be a fantastic experience for writers, programmers, designers, and all those who write the docs.

Talk proposals will open soon.
Start gathering your ideas and getting excited about another year of great talks and conversations.
