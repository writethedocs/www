Hi all,

You're receiving this email because you expressed interest in helping organize a Write the Docs NA conference on the East Coast in 2017. It contains information about the location and venue the organizers have considered, and a link to new material in the organizer manual to help orient you to possible roles you might fill. I realize that only one or two of you live in the DC area -- remote organization can also work, but it takes some additional planning and it will help if you have some familiarity with the DC area. Said familiarity is not required, but if you don't know DC, it could affect the organizer roles that make sense for you to assume.

### Location and Venue

Jennifer Rondeau, co-organizer of WTD NA in Portland for two years now, recently moved to DC, and is willing to be organizer in chief on the ground, so the DC area might make the most sense. Eric Holscher, original founder of WTD NA, also has family in the DC area and has already looked into this possibility for a venue:

I (Jennifer) visited a couple of weeks ago and met with the owner and event coordinator. We discussed a somewhat shorter event (two days, 10am to 4pm Monday-Tuesday in early October). Their initial quote is pretty high, but they seem pretty flexible and I'm continuing to discuss alternatives with them. We've been asked, though, to decide on dates by the end of summer 2016.

The venue is already set up to host conferences, unlike the Crystal Ballroom in Portland. This means that we don't need to worry about setting up wifi or taping down power cables -- big wins! They also offer full catering, so we'd need to decide on menus to accommodate dietary needs, but we would not need to find or wrangle catering.

There's a lot of new material in the organizer manual about event roles, and especially roles for helping with conferences. Please take a look, here:

I hope you can join us in planning an awesome east coast conference next year! Please let me know as soon as you can whether you're interested, and what kind of role you'd be willing to take on.

Warmly,

Jennifer Rondeau
