        "abstract": "Open source communities attract and boast passionate, idealistic people, and many of us invest copious amounts of time and effort to contribute to our projects and support our communities. This underlying emotional attachment can make us more vulnerable to elevated stress, burnout and conflicts. And then there are those of us who also manage mental illness.\nMore often than not, we suffer these struggles in silence, feeling (and fearing) that we’re alone in our trouble. Here, our communities can make a huge difference, by building a positive and safe environment where we can blossom and support ourselves and our peers, and feel included.\nThis talk will take a look at open-source communities through the eyes of various mental well-being issues and struggles, show various things that some communities already do. We will also cover several new initiatives from the community around Django, a common open-source web framework for Python, to further promote the well-being of our community members. This will hopefully inspire more communities to help foster healthy minds in a healthy environment."

Our final publications may have all the words in the right order, but sometimes our biggest challenge is getting access to the right content in the first place.</p>\n<p>Deciding on what is the right content can often be hard, and extracting it from the development team can be even harder. Some of us might be able to read the codebase to decipher what information a user will need. Some of us might get to sit in planning and strategy meetings to gain a thorough understanding of our user and their documentation requirements. Most of us though will find something in the middle - we sit with developers and engineers, build relationships, and elbow our way into their process. </p>\n<p>This talk will look at several ways in which to mentor your engineering and marketing specialists so that everyone in your team can contribute to the documentation process. I call this \"Documentoring\" - its about training the people around you to understand the requirements of a documentarian, and to truly value the docs as part of the product lifecycle.</p>\n<p>Through my experience at IBM, and then at a small startup in Bristol, I've seen (and tried) various techniques at getting everyone in your team invested in quality documentation. I'll share stories of my successes and failures, and show you how documentation really can be a team effort, even if you stand alone in your company as the sole owner of the docs.</p>"

The dominant model of today's APIs is the RESTful model, with neatly orthogonal resources, each occupying its own endpoint, and thoughtful use of the HTTP verbs to perform actions with or on resources.</p>\n<p>Much like the third normal form of database schema design, this conceptual purity is rarely found in the wild, as technical and practical constraints force us to a less-pure architecture for our information. Documenting \"perfect\" APIs is already a gargantuan task, documenting the mutations foisted upon your API by deadlines, performance constraints, and legacy support can be a nightmare.</p>\n<p>Enter GraphQL, a conceptually different approach to APIs. An open-source specification from Facebook, GraphQL permits clients to ask for the data that they want in the shape which they want it. This shift makes it far simpler to support clients over time, without versioned API endpoints. It makes it easier for developers consuming the API to change directions without requiring work from backend developers to alter the API responses.</p>\n<p>It's a fundamentally new way to do APIs, and it is rapidly growing in popularity. GraphQL implementations already exist for every language under the sun. GraphQL's reference implementation comes with tooling for building queries interactively in a browser, including autocompletion and INLINE DOCS (!!!111!one).</p>\n<p>How do we think about documenting APIs when the underlying model we've been using for the past decade is no longer? What cool stuff can we do that we couldn't do before?</p>\n<p>This talk is part API history lesson, part introduction to GraphQL, and part a tour of the documentation affordances provided by GraphQL.</p>"

One the one hand, we ran more than 20 semi-structured interviews with junior and senior developers and asked them \u2013 among other things \u2013 to tell us about the questions they raise first when approaching a new API, the type of documentation they look for, and general expectations and experiences regarding API documentation. Key findings derived from the interviews were then followed up on by a standardized survey in which more than 110 developers participated. Our second study took a different approach. Instead of asking developers what they find important about API documentation, we asked them to solve a few tasks on a simple (REST)-API that was unfamiliar to them. The goal of this study was to observe how the developers approach the tasks and which pieces of the documentation provided with the test API they actually use. Besides presenting the design and main findings of our studies, I will also discuss implications the results may have regarding the contents, structure and design of API documentation.</p>"

Building story arcs: arguably, all fiction boils down to about seven different plots, retold in millions of different ways. Understanding underlying story structure makes the process of writing new tales much easier. Those story structures and plot elements can map directly to parts of documentation, as well as show options for creating standing elements for documentation. * Writing prose worth reading: documentation can be enjoyable to read, provided a writer is willing to invest time in crafting good reading material.\nThis talk will draw on examples from both popular fiction and documentation out in the world today.</p>"

        "abstract": "<p>Two years ago, Atlassian had no consistent voice guidelines across its content channels and product suite, creating a disjointed brand experience. Today, our Information Experience writers now own the Atlassian voice and tone, and are teaching everyone from developers, product managers, designers, and marketers how to voicify their content. </p>\n<p>In this talk, Sarah Karp (Information Experience Team Lead) will answer the following questions: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the Atlassian voice? </li>\n<li>Why is a consistent voice important?</li>\n<li>How can you apply voice and tone to a piece of UI copy? </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Along the way, Sarah will share ways in which the Information Experience writers have applied voicify guidelines across the entire organization. She'll also share a couple of lessons on voice and tone gone wrong and how to learn from those mistakes. </p>\n<p>At the end of the talk, you'll come away with an understanding of why successful products have a distinctive voice and tone. You'll also come away with great examples of voice and tone wins (and fails), and practical tips about how to create voicify guidelines for writers and non-writers alike. </p>"

        "abstract": "<p>Treating docs as code, an approach that more and more teams and companies are moving toward, involves more than putting the two together in a repo. We discuss some of the details that often get lost in as dev and docs learn to work together in new ways. Because if all we do is put doc files next to code files in source control, or use parts of the same workflow for code and docs, we're still isolating docs as a separate sort of responsibility, free from the obligations of systematic review and testing without which code would never be accepted into production.</p>\n<p>Some missing parts of this newer approach to documentation workflow that we'll discuss include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outlining a documentation lifecycle that describes how material moves from initial draft to final production, to help people unfamiliar with documentation development understand better how to efficiently manage documentation review and testing.</li>\n<li>Mapping GitHub workflow clearly to documentation workflow. This can help writers and editors understand better just how to use GitHub effectively, and equally important how it can help other contributors (notably programmers) understand the parts of the writer workflow that can be lost when docs move next to code.</li>\n<li>Creating an information architecture. Words need structure to provide meaning, usability, and discoverability. A strong content architecture provides logical places for adding new content, especially for doc projects at scale.</li>\n<Li>Developing and enforcing a style guide: terminology, voice, tone. These things make the difference between words that users might understand, and documentation that can truly assist.</li>\n<li>Reviewing and line/copy editing. Because you wouldn't do any less for code, right?</li>\n</ul>"
