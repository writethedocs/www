Sam has been organizing Write the Docs conferences for around a decade now.
He lives in Berlin unless he's off to a conference or death metal festival somewhere, both of which happen more often than you'd think.
Sam does various documentation things at various places, and is into making computers do the boring bits of writing docs so he can work on the fun bits. Often available for part time work.
