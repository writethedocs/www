Getting around
--------------

Portland is a very accessible city and there are many transportation options available, public and otherwise. Portland is divided into six quadrants (with Burnside Avenue delineating north and south sections, and the Willamette River separating west and east sections). It is a city of neighborhoods, and each has its own distinct personality. We encourage you to connect with other documentarians and explore our unique neighborhoods during your stay.

Public transportation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are four bus lines that run close to Revolution Hall. If you're coming from downtown, you can take lines 15 (Belmont), 12 (Sandy Blvd.), 19 (Glisan), or 20 (Burnside). If you are coming from the Convention Center area, the best bet is to take line 70 (12th Ave.). Check the `TriMet Trip Planner <https://trimet.org>`__ for more information.

Portland has an extensive `bus network <http://trimet.org/bus/>`__ as well as a `separate streetcar network <http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/>`__.
The `MAX <http://trimet.org/max>`__ is Portland's major light-rail system. The MAX primarily connects Portland with the surrounding cities, such as Gresham, Beaverton, Clackamas, and Hillsboro. If you're flying into Portland Airport (PDX), there is a MAX station for the `Red Line <http://trimet.org/schedules/maxredline.htm>`__ in the airport itself.

If you are planning on using MAX, Portland Streetcar and/or city buses frequently during your stay, it may be worth investing in the `Hop Fastpass <https://myhopcard.com/>`__ fare card system. Or, it's easy to tap your credit card for a one-time ride. You may purchase MAX tickets from a ticket machine at the airport. Be sure to buy a ticket before boarding the train.

We recommend you use the `TriMet Trip Planner <https://trimet.org>`__. 

Rideshare/taxi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Taking a rideshare or taxi is a convenient option for getting to Revolution Hall and around Portland. Portland has both Lyft and Uber, and they are quite popular. If you prefer local taxi companies, here are a few recommendations:

- `Radio Cab <http://www.radiocab.net/>`__
- `Broadway Cab <http://www.broadwaycab.com/>`__
- `Portland Taxi <http://portlandtaxi.net/>`__

Please note that it is *not* common to hail taxis in Portland, and that your best bet is to call in advance.

Bike rentals
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two bike rental companies in downtown Portland that may be good options if you want to experience Portland by bike (which we very much recommend), and a bikeshare program:

- `Cycle Portland <http://www.portlandbicycletours.com/>`__
- `Biketown <https://www.biketownpdx.com>`__

Driving
~~~~~~~
If you drive to the conference,
note that the venue doesn't have parking on-site.
You are able to park in the nearby neighborhood in street parking for free.

**Any of the streets east of the venue (15th Ave and higher) allow for all-day street parking.**
