What to bring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

May in Portland can be interesting. It will probably be in the 60s, with a chance of rain. So, please bring:

- Comfortable shoes, that you are comfortable getting a bit muddy.
- 1 Liter of water. There is water available halfway through the hike.
- A light rain jacket. It won't be cold, but it might drizzle on you.
- High spirits!

The hike
--------

The hike will be around 5 miles long, and have 1000 feet of elevation gain.
This classifies as a *moderate* hike. We'll be going nice and slow so people can appreciate the views and forest.

Meander
~~~~~~~

The hike will follow Balch Creek up from the entrance of `Forest Park <http://www.forestparkconservancy.org/>`__.

Climb
~~~~~

Then we will switchback through beautiful forest until we get to Pittock Mansion.
Pittock affords one of the best views of the city, and hopefully Mt. Hood & Mt. St. Helens if it's clear!

Admire
~~~~~~

After this we will descend into `Washington Park <http://washingtonparkpdx.org/>`__, and the beautiful `Hoyt Arboretum <http://www.hoytarboretum.org/>`__.
There are a number of paths through Hoyt, and we can play that by ear.
More than 5,800 specimens from around the world grow here, including more than 1,100 species, which are valuable in reforesting damaged habitats.

Finish
~~~~~~

On the other side of Hoyt is the `Oregon Zoo <http://www.oregonzoo.org/>`__, where we can take the MAX back to downtown.
People who wish to stay around in the park or zoo are more than welcome.
