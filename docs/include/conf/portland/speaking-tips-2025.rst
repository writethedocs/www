Are you giving a talk at this year's in-person {{city}} Write the Docs? Great! Here are a
few things that may help you plan for preparing and presenting your talk.

- The more you practice your talk, the more comfortable you'll be when presenting. In addition to practicing by yourself, we strongly recommend you do it in front of at least one other human.
- If you haven't spoken before, your time will likely be shorter than when you are practicing.
- Make sure your slides are high contrast.
- Include where you want people to find you (e.g., LinkedIn, Bluesky) so people can properly attribute your brilliance.

If you want to get some of that sweet internet buzz for your talk, we use the #writethedocs hashtag throughout the event.

Inclusive Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- We strongly encourage all speakers to check and double-check their talks for any language that might be discriminatory or offensive.
- This includes needlessly gendered language. **For example, we actively avoid using 'you guys'.**
- Avoid ageist language (please no 'so easy my grandma could do it!' anecdotes), and any other language that's presumptive about or exclusive towards the variety of folks who will be in the audience.
- We know there's a ton of nuance and complexity here, just do your best to be aware of and sensitive about your language choices! If you have any doubts about any of your language, feel free to ask us in advance.

Good resources on this include:

- `The 18F Guide to Inclusive Language <https://content-guide.18f.gov/inclusive-language/>`__
- `The Responsible Communication Style Guide <https://rcstyleguide.com/>`__
- `GDS design principles <https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#this-is-for-everyone>`__
