Hello!

We’re |WelcomeWagonNames| your Welcome Wagon, and we’re glad you’re attending Write the Docs!
We realize a virtual conference might be totally new to you.
This guide will help you navigate it,
even if you’ve been to a Write the Docs conference before.

Whether this is your first Write the Docs conference or your first virtual Write the Docs conference,
we'll be here to help you make the most of it.
We’d love to virtually meet you:
feel free to ask anything in the #helpdesk channel at the virtual conference (not private)
or send us a direct message
if we can help make your time at the conference easier.
You can also email us at {{ shortcode }}@writethedocs.org.

Where to get help
-----------------

Guides
~~~~~~

You can prepare for the conference by reading through this guide.
Don’t worry if you forget any of it –
we'll be waiting at the #helpdesk channel on Venueless for any questions you might have.

Helpdesk
~~~~~~~~

Have a look at the `FAQ section <#faqs>`__ we put together based on questions we got at previous conferences.

If you still have questions, reach out the Welcome Wagon staff at the Helpdesk anytime.
Find **#helpdesk** under *Channels*.
If you don't see it there, select **Browse all channels** and join the **Helpdesk**.
A member of the Welcome Wagon will be online during conference hours to help you.

Message organizers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to contact one of the conference organizers,
select **+Open a direct message** and search for an organizer's name.
It's best to use the #helpdesk channel as not all organizers are available all the time.
You can also email us at {{ shortcode }}@writethedocs.org.

Slack
~~~~~

We'll also be posting important conference updates on the `#wtd-conferences channel in Slack <https://writethedocs.slack.com/archives/C1AKFQATH>`__.
For example, if there are technical issues, we'll share the back-up stream link there as well.

Helpful information
-------------------

When you first enter the virtual conference, you’ll be at the **Welcome** page.
This page provides a general overview of the conference.
The top of the virtual conference offers other helpful pages,
such as the Sponsor Expo, conference schedule, and plan for Writing Day and the Unconference.

Don’t be afraid to explore!
You won’t interrupt anything by looking around.

Conference talks and Q&A
------------------------

Watching talks live
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- There’s a talk schedule at the top of the sidebar under **Conference Schedule**.
  It offers times in three timezones.
- When it’s time for a talk you want to see, under *Stages* select **Stage**.
- If we have problems with the online platform, we will set up a back-up stream.
  If turned on, we will post links to the back-up stream in the conference chat and on the `#wtd-conferences channel in Slack <https://writethedocs.slack.com/archives/C1AKFQATH>`__.
- After a talk, feel free to tweet about it with the hashtag #writethedocs.

Asking questions and getting answers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Immediately following each talk will be a moderated Q&A session.

To ask a question, during either the talk or the Q&A session:

1. In the Stage, open the **Questions** tab.
2. Select **Ask a question**.
3. Enter your question and select **Submit your question**.

If there is time, a moderator will ask the question to the speaker.
Note that the moderator might put their own twist on the questions or their order.

View all questions asked and vote for those you find most interesting in the **Questions** tab.
If your question isn’t asked live, chat with the speaker later and make a connection!

Watching talks after the conference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't worry if you miss something in a talk!
Stage talks, Q&A sessions, and lightning talks are recorded.
Videos will be published in the `Write the Docs Video Archive <https://www.writethedocs.org/videos/>`__ shortly after the conference
(typically about a week after the conference ends).
To be notified when videos are published, `sign up for our newsletter <https://www.writethedocs.org/newsletter/>`__
or `subscribe to our YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/c/WritetheDocs/?sub_confirmation=1>`__.

Other sessions (such as Unconference, Hallway, and Writing Day sessions) are not recorded.

Participate in the conference
-----------------------------

The schedule is built around **sessions**.
Almost all of the in-person interactions you’ll have at the virtual conference will be through sessions.
Here's how to find and participate in sessions.
Use these lessons for attending Writing Day, Unconference, and sponsor sessions.

Find events to participate in
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view the schedule by selecting **Conference Schedule** at the top of the sidebar.
You can also browse a list of Writing Day and Unconference events by selecting the table schedule in the sidebar.

Join an event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With events like the Unconference, you can join in more actively with audio and optionally video.

Find the channel for the event you want to join under *Channels*
or by selecting **Browse all channels** and searching for the channel name.
Channels with options for active participation are visually marked with a webcam,
while text-only channels are visually marked with a #.

When you join a channel with the option for active participation,
you can choose to only listen or to connect your microphone.
The first time you select to use your microphone,
your browser prompts you to allow access to your microphone.
To change your connection after joining,
select the **Leave audio** (a headphones icon) at the bottom and rejoin the audio with your preference.

To join a channel with video, first join with audio
and then select **Share webcam** (a video camera icon) at the bottom.
The first time you select to use video,
your browser prompts you to allow access to your camera.

When you navigate away from a channel with audio to someplace without it
(such as the schedule or a text-only channel),
you stay connected to the audio and the audio channel is minimized in your browser.
To leave it fully, select **✕ Close**.

Helpful settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- To turn off your video, select **Stop sharing webcam** (a video camera icon).
- To turn off your audio, select **Mute** (a microphone icon).
  Consider muting your audio when you are not talking.
- To share your screen, select **Share your screen** (a monitor icon).
- To change your audio or video settings in a channel,
  select **Options** (three vertical dots) > **Settings**.
  Once you select **Save**, your settings are saved for that channel (not others).

Writing Day
-----------

`Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/writing-day/>`__
takes place on {{date.day_two.dotw}}, the day before the conference starts.
You can join in anytime {{date.day_two.writing_day_time}} {{tz}}.

You can bring a writing project you want to work on,
or you can contribute to a project someone else brought.

{% if unconf and unconf.url %}
- **Bring a project**: If you want help with your project,
  `sign up <{{ unconf.url }}>`__ before Writing Day.
  When you are ready to start your project on Writing Day,
  find your table under *Channels*, and start collaborating.
- **Contribute to a project**: If you want to help someone else with their writing project,
  `check out the list of projects <{{ unconf.url }}>`__. When you are ready to participate, go to **Sessions**, select the session for the project you want to contribute to, and introduce yourself.
{% endif %}

Unconference
------------

- The Unconference is a set of informal sessions that take place all day Monday and Tuesday afternoon.
  `Unconference talks focus on conversations and exchanges of ideas between participants. <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/unconference/>`__
- You can attend unconference sessions or, if you have an idea for a session, you can lead one.
  Anyone can lead an unconference session,
  as long as they have a discussion idea and a willingness to encourage attendees to talk about it.
- Learn more about the Unconference by reading the `Unconference Cheat Sheet <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/unconference-cheatsheet/>`__.

Lead an unconference session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Anyone can lead an unconference session,
  as long as they have a discussion idea and a willingness to encourage attendees to talk about it.
{% if unconf and unconf.url %}
- Look for an empty slot on the `Unconference sign-up <{{unconf.url}}>`__
  and add your Unconference topic.
  There will be a time and a table number for each slot.
{% else %}
- Look for an empty slot on the Unconference sign-up and add your Unconference topic.
  There will be a time and a table number for each slot.
{% endif %}
- When it’s time for your Unconference session to begin,
  find your table under *Channels*.
- The previous unconference session will be at the same table.
  Let the attendees of the previous session know that their time is up
  and your session will begin soon.
- Once a group has entered your session, start the conversation!
- When the Unconference leader for the next session enters the session,
  finish up your discussion to make way for the next one.

Tips for your unconference session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Avoid doing roundtable introductions.
  You might run out of time to actually start the conversation!
- Start the session with a prompt:
  Think of a question that you have about the topic of your unconference and ask it.
  The conversation typically works itself out after that.
  If there’s a lull, ask the group if anyone else has a question to ask.
- People can join the session with audio and video, but others may just be in the chat.
  Be sure to check the session chat regularly and include people there in the conversation.
- Be on the lookout for people who aren’t joining in and invite them to speak.
  Don’t insist if they make it clear they want to listen only.

Join an unconference session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Starting Monday morning, check the `Unconference sign-up <{{unconf.url}}>`__
  to see if there are any sessions you are interested in joining.
  New ones are added all the time, so check back periodically.
{% if unconf and unconf.url %}
- At the time the session starts,
  find the table under *Channels* that corresponds to the one in the `Unconference schedule <{{unconf.url}}>`__.
{% else %}
- At the time the session starts,
  ind the table under *Channels* that corresponds to the one in the Unconference schedule.
{% endif %}
- The session leader will begin the session when the group has gathered.
- You do not need to sign up anywhere to join a session.

Lightning talks
---------------

- A lightning talk is a five-minute talk
  where you quickly share a concept or bit of info you find interesting.
  Lightning talks are a great way to practice public speaking,
  get people excited about your Unconference session,
  and test interest in a conference proposal idea.
- If you are interested in giving a lightning talk, be prepared!
  Read our `guide to lightning talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/lightning-talks/>`__.
- Sign-ups for Lightning Talks will open on Sunday at the start of Writing Day,
  close a while before the first session to allow us to select talks,
  and then reopen right after the Monday Lightning Talk session.
- Watch the conference chat and your browser window
  for an announcement that Lightning Talk sign-ups have opened and for directions on how to sign up.
- If you are selected to speak, one of the Organizers will contact you with more information.

Sponsor Expo
--------------

The Sponsor Expo, highlighting companies that are hiring or offering products for docs,
takes place on Tuesday.
For the exact times, see the `schedule <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/schedule/>`__.

Select **Sponsor Expo** at the top of the sidebar to view Sponsor booths.
Sponsors might have videos you can watch, information to review, and people you can talk to.
Visiting Sponsor booths is a great way to make connections!

Networking
----------

All conversations should adhere to the `Write the Docs Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__.

Add info to your profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add information about yourself to your conference profile,
select your name (in the bottom left).
In addition to editing your display name, you can include your pronouns, company, and job title.
When you're ready, select **Save**.

Note: Any info you add to your profile can be seen by everyone attending the conference.

Reach out to attendees
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways to network using the virtual conference platform.

Direct messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- You can direct message attendees by selecting **+ Open a direct message** next to *Direct messages*
  and finding the person you want to message.
- When you're in a channel or the main Stage,
  you can see a list of all of the people currently with you.
  Select a person's name and then **Message** to send them a message.

Session-specific chat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you view the main Stage or are in a channel,
you can chat with the other people currently there with you.

Hallway sessions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under *Channels*, you'll find multiple channels marked as *Hallway*.
These are specifically for casually talking with other attendees.
You can join with your own audio and video or chat only.

Here are some icebreakers:

- What are you reading for fun right now?
- If you could start a business, what would it be?
- What is the best vacation you’ve ever been on?
- Are you working on any passion projects right now?
- What are your favorite podcasts?
- What is the most surprising thing that happened to you in the past week?
- What drew you to your work?

Video calls
^^^^^^^^^^^

When you view another attendee's profile by clicking on their name,
you see a button to call them.
This is a great way to continue a conversation that started in an Unconference or Hallway session.

  Give your brain a break!
