What is a Writing Day?
----------------------

Writing Day is modeled after the concept of “code sprints” or “hackathons”, which are common in 
open-source (OSS) conferences. The main goal is to get interesting people in the same room and have them 
work towards shared goals.

There are two main types of Writing Day attendees:

* Folks looking to potentially contribute to OSS projects and other cool content
* Volunteers bringing ideas, content, or OSS projects

The Write the Docs conference has many enthusiastic attendees. These attendees, documentarians, want to learn new 
technologies, sharpen their skills, and add to their portfolios. The world of open source has a seemingly endless 
number of wonderful open source projects. Documentarians want to write the docs, your open source project docs. 

It's a match made at Write the Docs!

Reminder, Write the Docs is a ticketed conference and you need to purchase a ticket to attend Writing Day.

How does Writing Day work?
--------------------------

Great question, here is an overview:

* First the event coordinator welcomes everyone and gives a Writing Day introduction.
* During the introduction, we invite people to give a project summary.
* The project introduction include the title, a short description, and their table number - so you can find them.
* After all the projects are announced, you are welcome to check them out!

Attendees can stay for as long or short as they want! They can try out as many projects as they feel like. 
Some folks enjoy sticking at one table for the entire event, others like to table hop and get a feel for 
multiple projects. 

As a project, you may not accomplish all of your goals or agenda. This is normal for events like these, m
any projects continue to receive contributions after Writing Day ends.

There is a basic level of information we need to add your project to the Writing Day list. `Submitting the form <https://forms.gle/JZanD3zWTBrrdL79A>`_ 
is an easy way to give us that info. You are welcome to submit your project info to `Writing Day <https://github.com/writethedocs/www/blob/main/docs/conf/atlantic/2023/writing-day.rst>`_ using a PR.

Here's an overview of the information we need, make sure your PR includes the following:

* Project name/title
* Short project description
* Overview of your project's goals for Writing Day and why they are important or useful
* Project URL and any other useful links to resources such as your style guide and contribution guidelines
* Anything else you think is helpful for us to know
* The PR description needs your name, pronouns, and a way to contact you or other project volunteers.

Maximize your experience
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We want you to have a great experience as a project and community. We have found that the projects who
get the most value out of Writing Day came prepared in the following ways:

* **Writing Day label**: Creating a specific event label allows you to identify tasks and issues that are good for new contributors.
* **Pre-labeled tasks and issues**: Labeling the documentation tasks and issues empowers new contributors 
  to find tasks that interest them.
* **Task filter**: Creating a task filter helps contributors find issues more easily and see which issues have been assigned.
* **Clear onboarding**: Ensuring your ReadMe, contribution guidelines, or onboarding instructions are accurate and up to date.
* **Specific focus or goals**: Projects that clearly define a focus area or a goal for their Writing Day tasks have 
  an advantage when it comes to enticing attendees to work on their project.
* **Project overview**: Your project overview is a quick pitch that describes your project and what you're hoping to 
  get out of Writing Day, such as your goals or focus. Need some ideas? Here's a good example from Writing Day 2022, the `Open Web Docs <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2022/writing-day/#open-web-docs>`_ project.
* **Writing Day project list**: Adding your project to the `Writing Day project list <https://forms.gle/NNBzBCwjdB2vF7ZeA>`_ promotes
  your project to our attendees before the event. Many attendees have told us that their curiosity about certain projects 
  incentivised their attendance.
* **Project experts**: We recommend having 1-2 project experts of some kind at Writing day. We love our developer advocates, community 
  managers, and subject matter experts! You're welcome to call for virtual reinforcements from your community as well.

**Reminder**: Documentarians have a variety of backgrounds and may need additional info to be successful in onboarding to your project!

Make a case for Writing Day
---------------------------

Need to convince your OSS project community or corporate benefactors the benefits of attending, this should help:

Write the Docs conferences bring together everyone who writes the docs – tech writers, developers, developer relations, 
customer support – making the event an ideal networking opportunity.

Writing Day is a community event modeled after the concept of “code sprints” or “hackathons”, which are common in open-source 
conferences. The idea is to get a bunch of people together and have them work towards a shared goal, in this case the goal is
creating or improving documentation.

This event introduces your project and community to a new audience in your industry. These attendees, documentarians, want to 
learn new technologies, sharpen their skills, and add to their portfolios. They come to your projects with their own experience 
and expertise in areas such as technical writing and editing, user experience and research, and customer support. Their collective
wealth of experience can help you upgrade your project documentation and create a more inclusive project. 

The truth is that it benefits your open source projects and your communities just as much as our attendees.
This empowers all of us to work together to create opportunities for each other and bigger, better communities.
