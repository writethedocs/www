Tips for Attendees
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're attending the Job Fair, it helps to do a little work up front:

* Come up with a few questions you will ask folks from the company. Some options here include questions about work culture, documentation tooling, or hybrid work situations.
* Prep a resume or have a business card on hard to easily share your contact info.
* Plan to ask for a card or contact info for the jobs that you like, so you can also be proactive in outreach.

Tips for Sponsors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to maximize your contacts with potential new employees, make sure to:

* Ensure you have some fun swag items or handouts available for folks who are interested in your jobs.
* Make sure your booth staff are registered before the conference starts.

All sponsor contacts will receive details about posting jobs and registering a few weeks before the conference.
