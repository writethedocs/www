Giving a Presentation at Write the Docs
=======================================

Are you giving a talk at this year’s Write the Docs? Great! Here are a
few things that may help you plan your talk and your slides.

Facts
-----

-  Your talk will be 30 minutes long.
-  There will be no time for questions immediately following your talk,
   plan to use the entire slot.
-  We strongly recommend that you practice your talk, ideally in front
   of at least one other person.
-  We will have a lapel mic for you, so you don’t need to hold a microphone.
-  We will provide HDMI, USB-C and MiniDisplay port adapters.
-  The display ratio of the projector is 16:9

Presentation
------------

**We do not be allow time after the presentations for questions**, we
feel posing questions for the speaker is best done in small groups.
We do encourage the speaker to be available for questions offstage after their talk.

Make sure when you practice your presentation, you are not counting on
extra time at the end for questions. You should plan on speaking for the
full 30 minutes of your speaking slot. Don’t worry if you run a little
short on time however, we are happy to provide attendees with extra time
during talk breaks.

If you haven’t spoken before, your time will likely run a bit shorter on stage than when you are practicing.
Matt Haughey wrote a guide on `giving a presentation <https://medium.com/@mathowie/an-introverts-guide-to-better-presentations-be7e772b2cb5>`__ that might be a tremendous help to you if you are new to presenting to an audience.
This `article on speaking <https://hynek.me/articles/speaking/>`__ from Hynek is also a wonderful source, which covers the steps to prepare for a talk.

There are a lot of different ways of thinking through making your slides.
Idan Gazit, a previous speaker, has written up a `great post <http://gazit.me/2012/12/05/designing-presentations.html>`__ on how his process works.
Yours might not be the same, but it might be useful to think through the process.

Diversity and Inclusivity

Slides
------

You’ll be responsible for making sure your laptop, or other display
device, is ready for your presentation. Be familiar with setting up an
external display on your machine, each presenter will have several
minutes for set up before the talk starts.

We also provide an opportunity to test the video connection after the Writing Day.
If you are not around on Sunday but would still like to test the video setup, just let us know.

Here are a few other tidbits to remember:

-  Make sure that your slides are **high contrast**. It will make them
   easier for everyone to read in the room.
-  Try not to use the bottom ~10% of your slides, as they might not be
   visible to everyone.
-  Include your Twitter handle on your slides, so people can quote you
   properly :)
-  Slides should be 16:9 resolution
-  Have a PDF backup of your slides, just in case :)

Christina Elmore gave a great talk that is relevant to many of us at our
2014 conference. Resist your urge to document with your presentation,
you are here for the room. We highly recommend watching the full talk:
