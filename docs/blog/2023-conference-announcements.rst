Announcing Write the Docs conferences for 2023
==============================================

We're excited to announce two Write the Docs conferences for 2023:

* **Write the Docs Portland on May 7-9, 2023**, an in person conference in Portland, Oregon.
* **Write the Docs Atlantic, on September 10-12, 2023**, a new virtual conference
  in between European/African and US East Coast/South America timezones.

Write the Docs Prague is taking a break this year. Announcements about
Write the Docs Australia will follow later in 2023.

Write the Docs Portland
-----------------------

`Write the Docs Portland <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2023/>`_ will be an in person conference, similar to our
pre-COVID conferences. Speakers will be present in person and speaking
from the conference stage. We will also offer a free live stream of the talks, 
and remote participants are encouraged to participate in our Slack. The
unconference will not be streamed.
 
The conference will follow all local COVID regulations that apply at the time,
and we will announce more specific policies before our tickets go on sale so people can make an informed decision.

Write the Docs Atlantic
-----------------------

`Write the Docs Atlantic <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/atlantic/2023/>`_ is a new conference, in a similar online format
to the virtual conferences we've been running in 2021 and 2022.

The schedule will run from the
early afternoon to early evening in most European/African timezones,
and from early morning to late afternoon in US East Coast/South America timezones.
Of course, this being a virtual conference, attendees and speakers
are welcomed from anywhere in the world.

Sign up to the separate 
`Atlantic conference mailing list <https://www.writethedocs.org/newsletter/>`_ to stay
up to date on the call for proposals, ticket sales and all other updates.


Virtual and in person
---------------------
Although we initially switched to running virtual conferences due to COVID, we found
that despite many folks preferring the in-person experience, the virtual format also created many new opportunities.
There are many people that have difficulty travelling
to our in person conferences for various reasons, like financial, health,
immigration or responsibilities at home.
With a virtual conference, these people have equal access to
our events, as speakers or attendees. We've also seen that our
community has been great at bringing the same atmosphere that works
so well at our in person conferences, to our virtual ones.

Therefore, we think that the Portland and Atlantic conferences together
are a great way to bring back the familiar experience that many of you miss,
while also keeping the many benefits of virtual conferences in 2023.

Call for Proposals
------------------
For both conferences, we invite people from all across our community to
come up on the virtual or in person stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles,
so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager,
or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

**We plan to launch our Portland CFP in early January 2023** for those who are excited to speak.
The talks in Portland will be in person.

Further details of the Atlantic CFP will be announced later in 2023.
For Atlantic, you will need to supply a pre-recorded video of your talk,
so you'll be able to present from anywhere.

Start thinking about your talk proposal now, and we'll let you know as soon as the CFPs open.


Tickets
-------
**Tickets will go on sale in January 2023**.
We will announce ticket prices soon, so that you can start planning your budget.

As always, we keep ticket prices low so that it is accessible to the widest range
of people possible. However, if you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend,
we will be running our Opportunity Grants program again this year.

Sponsorship
-----------

We are always grateful for the organizations and projects that support our
community and help make our events extra awesome for the attendees.

for both conferences, including the Job Fair this year and a new option
for sponsored workshops.
