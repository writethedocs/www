Looking for a new newsletter editor
###################################

We're looking for a new editor to join the `team </team/#id5>`__ that creates the monthly `Write the Docs newsletter </newsletter>`__. If you're an active member of the community and would like to contribute to WTD, this might be for you!

Our outgoing editor has loved being on the team and would highly recommend it. It's a great opportunity to help a wide audience of documentarians, by sharing the knowledge from Slack in a more permanent form; it's also a fun way to practise or experiment with a different style of writing. The format isn't set in stone either - we welcome new ideas for how to make the newsletter even better.

--------------
What you'll do
--------------

You'll be responsible for putting together the newsletter each month. The process looks roughly like this:

- During the month, keep an eye on Slack and flag any interesting conversations.
- Towards the end of the month, pick 4-5 topics to turn into articles.
- Share the topics to be written up with our awesome team of writers, and write one yourself.
- Edit the articles into a coherent newsletter and fill out the rest (news, jobs, meetup) .

Overall it's a few hours of work each month - except for August and Janary, where we take a little holiday. For more detail, the whole process is documented (of course!) `on the WTD site </organizer-guide/newsletter/newsletter-process/>`__.
