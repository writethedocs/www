Write the Docs Community Update - January 2025
===============================================

Hey folks, Eric Holscher here, one of the co-founders of Write the Docs.
I'm here with our traditional January community update while the newsletter team takes the month off.

2025 is going be mostly a continuation of our efforts from last year.
We don't have any major new initiatives planned,
but we're continuing to refine our approach to conferences and building community.

We have 2 main actions for you to take today if you haven't already:

* Submit a `talk proposal <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/cfp/>`__ for our Portland conference by January 21.
* Fill out our `2024 Documentation Salary Survey <https://salary-survey.writethedocs.org/>`__ by January 31.

More details below.

2024 Salary Survey ends soon
----------------------------

The `2024 Salary Survey <https://salary-survey.writethedocs.org/>`_ is still open until January 31.
We've had fewer responses than last year so far, 
so please take a moment to fill it out or share it with a friend if you haven't already.
We plan to release the results in Q2, in time for the Portland conference.

Our 2025 conferences
--------------------

It was wonderful to see everyone at our 2024 Portland, Atlantic, and Australia conferences.
Our 2025 conferences will look similar to last year:

* `Portland <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/>`_ will be in-person on **May 4-6**.
* **Atlantic** will be a virtual event, spanning the East Coast and European timezones. We might push it a bit later in the year to avoid the many conferences that happen in mid September, but haven't firmed up dates.
* Australia just happened a month ago, and we haven't started planning for 2025 yet.

We are currently accepting `talk proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/cfp/>`_ and selling tickets for our Portland conference.
**Submit your talk proposals by January 21**.
Ticket sales will remain open until the week before the conference. 

We hope that you'll work with us to make all of our events unique again this year by submitting talks and showing up in-person or virtually.

Community board updates
-----------------------

The `Community Board <https://www.writethedocs.org/team/#community-board>`_ has been instrumental in guiding our strategic direction and supporting our community teams.
Here are some highlights from 2024:

* **Jobs and hiring support:** To better align with changing trends in the documentarian jobs market, we removed the job board and launched a new job sponsorship offering. We are also reviewing job-related Slack spaces to ensure they serve the community effectively.
* **Meetups:** The meetups team is auditing active meetup.com accounts and exploring alternatives to meetup.com. They are also updating guidelines for WTD sponsorship of meetup.com accounts.
* **Slack moderation:** Our moderation team continues to maintain a welcoming environment and fight spam in our Slack community. We are exploring ways to improve the onboarding experience for new members, but overall the community is in a good place.
* **Website and learning content:** We are seeking more dedicated maintainers for our website content and documentation guides. We're also trying to find better ways to promote our learning resources, including via social media.

You can find the full archives of Community Board updates on the `Community board blog tag <https://www.writethedocs.org/blog/archive/tag/community-board/>`_,
where we share status updates each quarter to keep the community informed.

Have a great year!

Thanks again for being part of our community and sharing the documentarian journey with us and with each other.
