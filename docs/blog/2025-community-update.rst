Write the Docs Community Update - August 2025
=============================================

Hey there documentarians!

Eric Holscher here, sharing this year's August community update.
We always do this to give the newsletter team a break in August.

We've been heavily focused on conferences this year, but our Slack community, Newsletter, Meetups, Salary Survey, and other initiatives continue without major changes. 

Our Portland conference was a great success
-------------------------------------------

The 2025 Portland conference was our largest yet, with 415 in-person attendees and 170 virtual participants.
New features like Sunday registration location, food carts, and expanded venue spaces helped make the experience even better.
All talk videos are available on our `YouTube playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZAeFn6dfHplMbtJtidqFFtL7rt3ASNSR>`_
and the `full recap blog post <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/news/thanks-recap/>`_ has lots more information.
We're excited to see everyone again in Portland in 2026,
and will be announcing the dates soon.

Europe returns in-person
------------------------

The biggest news for 2025 is the return of our European conference, now in Berlin!  
After several years of virtual-only events, we're thrilled to be back in person in Europe for the first time since 2019.  
The Berlin conference will also feature a virtual component, so documentarians can join us from anywhere.  
Find out more and get your tickets on the `Berlin website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/berlin/2025/>`_.  
Thanks to our local team and everyone who helped make this possible!

Africa continues to grow
------------------------

We're excited to see our Africa community continue to grow, with Kenya hosting their first conference, and a `summit this year in Nigeria <https://sessionize.com/writethedocs-nigeria-conference-2025-bu/>`_.  
Read about the 2025 Kenya conference in their `recap blog post <https://wtdkenya.hashnode.dev/wtd-kenya-conference-2025>`_.  
We're excited to see the larger events growing from local meetups into larger conferences and summits.

Australia goes virtual for 2025
-------------------------------

Our `Australia conference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2025/>`_ will be virtual this year to maximize accessibility and participation.  
This decision was made to help more documentarians from across the region join in, regardless of travel constraints or budget.  
If you're interested in speaking or attending, check out the website for more details and updates as the event approaches.  

Community board and team updates
--------------------------------

Our Community Board has been busy this year, focusing on improving team coordination, keeping our community spaces positive, and supporting meetups with better tools and resources.  
We're grateful for the dedication of our team leads who keep the community thriving.
To catch up on all the updates, check out the `community board  posts <https://www.writethedocs.org/blog/archive/tag/community-board/>`_ archive. 

Looking ahead
-------------

As always, we're committed to making Write the Docs events welcoming and accessible for everyone.  
Whether you're joining us in Portland, Berlin, Africa, Australia, or online, we hope to see you soon!

Thank you for being part of our community and making the documentation world a little bit better.

          <strong>Finally, a business book that gets what you already know.</strong>

          You're already documenting processes, creating guides, and making complex things simple. But what if those skills could transform entire businesses?

          Write the Docs subscribers get preview access to "Systems Champion: Simplify Business Processes, Unlock Team Potential & Achieve True Freedom."

          This isn't another theory-heavy business book. It's a practical playbook that shows documentation pros how to become the most valuable person in any organization. The one who turns chaos into clarity and builds systems that actually stick.

          Get it before the public release. <a href="https://www.systemology.com/writethedocs/">Check it out here</a>.
