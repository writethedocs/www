Write the Docs Community Update - January 2026
===============================================

Hey folks, Eric Holscher here, one of the co-founders of Write the Docs.
I'm here with our traditional January community update while the newsletter team takes the month off.

2025 was a big year for us. We brought our Europe conference back to Berlin for the first time since 2019, continued refining our hybrid approach, and saw our community keep adapting to how the industry and our work keeps changing.

Two quick things before I dive into the details:

* Submit a `talk proposal <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2026/cfp/>`__ for Portland by **January 19**.
* Fill out our `2025 Documentation Salary Survey <https://salary-survey.writethedocs.org/>`__ by **January 31**.

2025 Salary Survey ends soon
----------------------------

The `2025 Salary Survey <https://salary-survey.writethedocs.org/>`_ closes January 31.
If you haven't filled it out yet, please do, or share it with someone who should.
We're planning to release results in April, in time for Portland.

Our 2026 conferences
--------------------

Seeing everyone in Portland, Berlin, and Kenya last year was great.
Kenya was the first year as an official conference, and Berlin marked our return to Europe for the first time in 5 years!

Berlin was a real highlight for me personally, and we're committed to making it a recurring part of our schedule.
We learned a lot about what worked (and what didn't) for both in-person and virtual attendees, and those lessons are shaping how we approach 2026.

Here's what we have planned:

* `**Portland** <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2026/>`_ is a hybrid event on **May 3-5**.
* **Berlin** is planned to return in the fall as a hybrid event (more details soon).
* **Australia** dates and format are still under discussion and we'll share updates when we have them.

As always, these events are only as magical as the community makes them. Submit a talk, show up in person or virtually, and help us make 2026 great!

Community board updates
-----------------------

The `Community Board <https://www.writethedocs.org/team/#community-board>`_ has been guiding our strategic direction and supporting our community teams.
Outside of our conferences, the team also focused on:

* **Community spaces and safety:** We reorganized internal team Slack channels, and Slack moderation kept up with a few new scams throughout the year.
* **Meetups and tooling improvements:** The meetups team streamlined organizer workflows, including a more reliable 2FA setup for virtual meetups.
* **Global community growth:** The Nigeria meetup hosted its first summit, and organizers from Kenya and other regions are exploring expanded activity.

You can find the full archives of Community Board updates on the `Community board blog tag <https://www.writethedocs.org/blog/archive/tag/community-board/>`_,
where we share status updates each quarter to keep the community informed.
