Write the Docs 2017 Stats
=========================

2017 was a wonderful year for Write the Docs, it marks our 5th year of existence.
The community is growing into a truly global community,
with events around the world.

This post contains stats that mark our progress,
so that we can look back and see how we've changed as a community.
We continue to grow and expand,
and we're glad to have you along with us!

.. note:: You can also read our post from `2016 <http://www.writethedocs.org/blog/write-the-docs-2016-year-in-review/>`_.

Conferences
===========

* 400 attendees in Portland (same as in 2016)
* 250 attendees in Prague (same as in 2016)
* 50 attendees in Australia (New)

The :doc:`conferences </conf/index>` continue to be the yearly physical manifestation of our community.
They are the time each year where hundreds of wonderful folks gather and have a great time,
while learning so much from each other.
Proving each year that work can be both fun and informative is one of my greatest pleasures.

We continue to publish :doc:`videos </videos>` freely to the public. 
Doing this is more inclusive to people who cannot attend the conferences, promotes learning, and is part of our :doc:`commitment to openness </about/about-the-org>`.

Slack Network
=============

* 3,000 (up from 1,200 members in 2016)

Slack has been quite active this past year. We've had an amazing amount of good conversations within the global community here!

Newsletter
==========

* 3,406 subscribers (up from 2,485 in 2016)

Our :doc:`newsletter </newsletter>` contains curated distillations from the slack conversations that you have every day.

Meetups
=======

* 5589 Members (up from 3109 in 2016)
* 30 Meetups (up from 18 Meetups in 2016)
* 4 Continents (same as in 2016)

Our :doc:`meetup community </meetups/index>` has continued to grow across the globe.

Podcast
=======

* 12 episodes (up from 2 episodes in 2016)

The podcast has been doing work again this year!

Website
=======

* 450,000 page views (up from 320,000 in 2016)
* 225,000 sessions (up from 180,000 in 2016)
* Guide: 210,000 views
* Conference Site: 175,000 views

The two primary parts of the site that get users are our :doc:`/guide/index` and :doc:`various conference sites </conf/index>`.

This is a new stat for this year, but we have historical data in Google Analytics to compare against.
This allows us to give the comparison from last year.

Thanks
======

At every conference I make it a point to thank the attendees.
People who believe in our community are the ones who make it happen.
So thank you to everyone who has been a part of making this community something that keeps growing and evolving.
I've been humbled by the empathy and wonderfulness of this community,
and all I can hope is that we continue to strive to be as helpful and welcoming as possible.

Here's to another wonderful year.
