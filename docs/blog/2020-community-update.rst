Write the Docs 2020 Community Update
====================================

Hey there documentarians!

The newsletter team is taking September off as usual,
but there's still plenty going on in the community.
We're sending out a update to let you know about a few things we're working on while they take a much deserved break.

We're looking forward to seeing everyone online for our `Prague <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2020/>`_ on October 18-20 in the CEST timezone.
We're also getting excited about our upcoming `Australia & India <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2020/>`_ conference on December 3-4 in the AEDT timezone.
The talks were just announced for Prague, and the CFP is open for a little while longer for Australia & India.

We also just recently wrapped up our first online Portland conference.
We had around 600 people join us to make this another memorable event.
The `videos <https://www.writethedocs.org/videos/portland/2020/>`_ are now online from that conference.

Salary Survey
-------------

We were amazed by the response to our Salary Survey last year.
We are excited to launch our new :doc:`2020 Salary Survey </surveys/salary-survey-sep-2020>`.

This annual survey, run by the Write the Docs community, aims to gather data about salaries for people working in documentation and related fields around the world. `Results of the inaugural survey <https://www.writethedocs.org/surveys/salary-survey/2019/>`_ are available on the our website.

We hope that this data can help our community members determine what appropriate salary ranges are, and provide a benchmark for future employment-related decisions and negotiations.
Additionally, we’re hoping the results spark discussion of employment-related trends and issues in our industry, including but not limited to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The survey is broken up into 5 sections.
It should take between 5 and 10 minutes to complete,
so we hope that you'll `fill it out <https://2020-salary-survey.writethedocs.org/>`_.

Community Shout Out
-------------------

The numbers of activities going on in the Write the Docs community grows each year.
Most of these are things are organized and run primarily by volunteers,
and we wanted to take time to show appreciation for these folks.
We will certainly miss many of people doing great work around out community,
but we wanted to show appreciation for folks in particular who are working behind the scenes.

Newsletter Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First up, as seems fitting, is our Newsletter team.
Y'all probably know Beth,
who is our editor,
but there is an entire group working behind the scenes to write the articles each month.
They are responsible for making this newsletter happen each month:

Meetup Coordination Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are too many meetup organizers to list across our lovely community.
Y'all get to know them at each meetup that you go to,
but behind the scenes there are folks who are doing coordination to make our meetup community stronger.
That is the job of the meetup coordination team,
and our meetups wouldn't be as useful without them:
