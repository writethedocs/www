Write the Docs Community Update - August 2024
=============================================

Hey there documentarians!

Eric Holscher here filling in for the Newsletter team as they take their normal August break.

We're looking forward to seeing everyone online for our virtual `Atlantic <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/atlantic/2024/>`_ on **September 22-24**. The event is scheduled to be available for both folks in EDT and CEST timezones. Tickets are still on sale until a few days before the event, so grab yours now if you haven't yet.

We're also getting excited about our upcoming `Australia <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2024/>`_ conference on **November 28-29** in Melbourne. The `Australia conference CFP <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2024/cfp/>`_ is open for a few more weeks if you have ideas, and can make it to Melbourne.

We held our second Portland conference in our new venue this year, and it felt like everything worked a little bit better than last year. You could really feel the improvement that another year of iterating on the event brought.  The `photos <https://www.flickr.com/photos/writethedocs/albums/72177720316224454/>`_ and `videos <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZAeFn6dfHpm4FboYSTD1Bs8Yp8k_JvAL>`_ from the conference are available.

2025 Conferences
----------------

We are still in the planning phase for our 2025 conferences, but expect the structure to remain similar. Our Portland conference will be **May 4-6, 2025**, and expect more updates about the other events as we get closer to the end of the year.

Kenya Event and Community Engagement
------------------------------------

We are thrilled to work with the Meetup team in Kenya to put on `a small gathering for their community <https://wtdkenya.hashnode.dev/write-the-docs-kenya-summit-2024>`_ this year! It was a great way to continue building the community locally, and we're excited to see more events like this in the future.

If you're interested in organizing a community event, please feel free to reach out to the core team. We have resources and support to help you get started on a Meetup, or to grow your meetup into a larger community event.

Job Board Transition
--------------------

We are looking at transitioning away from a job board and to a job sponsorship model that works similarly to our other `community sponsorship options <https://www.writethedocs.org/sponsorship/>`_. Our current job board vendor has raised their rates significantly, which caused us to reevaluate how to promote jobs in the community. Our Slack ``#job-posts-only`` channel has quite active with job postings, and we're looking to expand on that success.

The new format will likely have the option to promote a job in the newsletter, on Slack, or both. We're still working out the details, but we're excited to continue to help connect great companies with great documentarians.

Community Board Updates
-----------------------

Our Community Board continue to meet each quarter and post `meeting summaries <https://www.writethedocs.org/blog/archive/tag/community-board/>`_ for you to keep up to date with the discussions.
There haven't been too many large updates this year, but we continue to discuss various issues that come up across our teams,
and it's been a great place to think through how to grow the community in a sustainable way.

Documentation Salary Survey
---------------------------

Our annual salary survey gathers data about salaries for people working in documentation and related fields around the world. We heard from someone at our Portland conference that they were able to use this data to get a raise of 25%!

Our 2024 survey will open in early September, and we would love to have your input on the questions. There is a `Salary survey Github repo <https://github.com/writethedocs/salary-survey>`_ where you can see the proposed questions for this year, and contribute your thoughts on what should be included.

`Results of the 2023 salary survey <https://www.writethedocs.org/surveys/salary-survey/2023/>`__ are available on our website.
