Write the Docs 2021 Salary Survey
=================================

Hey there documentarians!

This is a special update to announce that the `2021 Salary Survey <https://salary-survey.writethedocs.org/>`_ is now live and ready for your input!

Survey says...
--------------

As we've seen with the `previous two surveys <https://www.writethedocs.org/surveys/>`_, being a documentarian can encompass many roles, teams, and industries. 
Our community is global and diverse, and the surveys reflected that. 
Every person who submits the survey helps the entire community, so we hope you'll take a few minutes and fill it out. 

We hope that the survey data can help our community members determine what appropriate salary ranges are, and provide a benchmark for future employment-related decisions and negotiations.

Additionally, weâ€™re hoping the results spark discussion of employment-related trends and issues in our industry, including but not limited to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The survey is divided into 6 sections, and takes between 5 and 10 minutes to complete, so go ahead and `fill it out <https://salary-survey.writethedocs.org/>`__. 

The survey will be open until **20th December, 2021**. 
Results will be published in early 2022. 
Shout out to `Kay Smoljak <https://twitter.com/goatlady>`_ for running this survey since it debuted in 2019!

Thanks
