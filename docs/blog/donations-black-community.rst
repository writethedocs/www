Matching donations made in support of the Black community
=========================================================

In recognition of `Juneteenth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth>`_ here in the United States,
we'd like to follow up on our :doc:`donation matching program </blog/we-stand-with-the-black-community>`
for non-profit organizations supporting the Black community and their ongoing efforts.

This week, we reached the goal of $1,500 in donations made by our community,
and Write the Docs made matching donations to nine different organizations.

We matched donations to the following organizations:

* NAACP Legal Defense Fund: $435
* UndocuBlack Network: $300
* Black Lives Matter Global Network: $290
* Color of Change: $190
* Black Alliance for Just Immigration (BAJI): $100
* WeTheProtesters, Inc: $70
* National Urban League: $50
* The Loveland Foundation: $50
* Black Minds Matter UK: $15

Thanks to all documentarians who donated.
We hope that this will continue to inspire folks to give money to these causes,
and support their efforts for justice.
