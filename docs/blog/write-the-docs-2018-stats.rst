Write the Docs 2018 Stats
=========================

2018 was another wonderful year for Write the Docs, it marks our 6th year of existence.

Since it's quiet over the holidays,
we normally don't do a newsletter in January.
Instead,
we send out a yearly update for the Write the Docs community,
filling you in on our progress.

I'm presenting the numbers without commentary,
except where it's useful for interpreting the numbers,
to facilitate comparison across the years.

.. note:: 
   
   You can also read our posts from 2016_ and 2017_.

Australia went from a one-day to a two-day conference,
growing from 50 to 100 attendees.

Slack Network

* 5,250 :doc:`members </slack>` (up from 3,000)

    * :doc:`Guide </guide/index>`: 225,000 views
    * :doc:`Conference sites </conf/index>`: 120,000 views

This is one place where we haven't seen a lot of growth.
We haven't added much new content to the guide this past year,
so I think that is the primary reason that traffic hasn't increased.

This would be a great place to get more contributions from the community,
if you're looking for a place to put those writing skills to use!

------

* 1250 commits_ to our repository
* 53 people_ who contributed to our repository

New this year,
we're keeping track of how many folks are contributing on GitHub.
Thanks to everyone who has contributed to keeping our website up to date and adding new content.
