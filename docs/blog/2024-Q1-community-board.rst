Write the Docs Community Board Quarterly Update Q1-2024
=======================================================

Greetings, documentarians! Mikey Ariel here, chairperson of the WTD community board. I'm happy to share with you the first quarterly update for 2024, the beginning of our second year of operation. 

To catch up on previous quarterly updates, check out the `community board blog posts <https://www.writethedocs.org/blog/archive/tag/community-board/>`_ archive. 

Q1 quarterly meeting highlights
-------------------------------

Our Q1 meeting included an informal retrospective on 2023, which was our first year of operation. As a newly grouped collection of team leads, we dedicated some of our efforts to exploring ways to collaborate with each other more proactively and evolving our meta-work tracking and priorities.

Some of the activities that our board members focused on in 2023:

* Reviewed and organized our Kanban board that is used for tracking community-wide task
* Launched a meetup organizer mailing list and completed a meetup survey, which helped to identify which meetups were still active and which meetups needed to be retired 
* Formalized communication channel for our team leads by establishing official WTD email addresses and mailing list management capabilities
* Started a deeper dive into social media strategies and how we can leverage the changing platforms that are available to use for sharing knowledge and engaging with the community outside of the conferences

In addition to discussing specific projects, our meetings always include space for team leads to share updates about their ongoing or current tasks that might be useful to the group or that might benefit from real-time brainstorming. 

As always, the board continues to review the community backlog to determine what are the most valuable efforts for the community in the short and long term. 

What is the community board
---------------------------

The `Community Board <https://www.writethedocs.org/team/#community-board>`_ exists to curate the overall strategic direction of the community teams.

The board members are team leads for each WTD team, as well as the conference chairs of our various conferences:

* Mikey Ariel (CoreOps, brand and design, board chair)
* Eric Holscher (CoreOps, Portland chair)
* Samuel Wright (CoreOps, infrastructure)
* Sasha Romijn (CoreOps, support, Atlantic chair)
* Rose Williams (meetups)
* Janine Chan (Slack moderation)
* Aaron Collier (newsletter)
* Swapnil Ogale (Australia chair)

The community board meets quarterly in real-time, and provides monthly asynchronous status updates. Board members can share the status of what they're working on and request any help to keep the various teams functioning effectively.

Thank you

Thanks again to the team leads that participate in the community board, and to all the team members (mostly volunteers!) who work diligently to support the community and each other.
