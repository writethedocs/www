Salary Survey: September 2019
=============================

.. note::
    The survey results are in :doc:`salary-survey/2019`

We're excited to launch our first ever survey,
a Salary Survey.

Our goal is to help people understand the pay scales and benefits in the software industry around documentation.
This will help people get a better understanding of what an appropriate salary is,
and then negotiate for a better one.

The survey is 21 questions broken up into 4 parts.

The salary was open until **October 31st, 2019**.
