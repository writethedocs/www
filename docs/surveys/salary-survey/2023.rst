Documentation Salary Survey 2023 Results
****************************************

Introduction
============ 

In this, the fifth annual Write the Docs documentation salary survey, we gathered data from a record-breaking 1017 individual respondents - 938 employees and 79 contractors - in 53 countries, working across dozens of industries, with experience ranging from less than one year to over 40 years. 

In a hurry? Jump straight to `Median salary`_ or `Median hourly rate`_.

   .. rubric:: |icon-info| Note on independent contractors, freelancers and the self-employed

   In this year's survey, we asked those who filled out the survey as independent contractors, freelancers or self-employed people what term they used to describe their type of employment. Just over half (53.2%) preferred the term "contractor", another 27.8% used "self-employed", and 16.5% used "freelancer". In this report, we'll use the term "contractors" to refer to this entire group.

Feedback
--------

We're always keen to hear your thoughts on this survey, so that we can continue to develop and refine it - and if you have used the data to help negotiate a raise or evaluate an offer, we would love to know about it! Email us at support@writethedocs.org with your feedback, ideas and experiences. 

Here are just some of the anonymous comments that respondents submitted in 2024:

.. pull-quote::

   I have a pretty good grasp on what salary I should be aiming for thanks to this survey! I hope other writers find this information as useful as I have. 

   WTD surveys (along with TechCommNZ surveys) are very useful in salary negotiations and my manager really appreciates that I bring facts and data to the table. In fact, we wait until info is available before sitting down each year.

   WTD Salary Survey helped me understand the value of my work. I decided to look for another job with a better pay range because of it. It gave me the courage to make that leap and get a higher-paying job.

   This has helped me ensure the members of my team are within an acceptable pay range and to advocate for across the board salary increases in the past.

Employment parameters
=====================

This section establishes the parameters of the respondent's employment: the type of employment, number of hours worked, job title and type of role, length of time in current position, and how focused the role is on documentation.

   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| Documentation is:

   - the whole of my official job description
   - part of my official job description
   - not officially part of my job description, but I am expected to perform documentation-related tasks
   - not officially part of my job description, and I am not expected to perform documentation-related tasks, but I do anyway

   Approximately what percentage of your day-to-day tasks are documentation-related?

   - 0-25%
   - 26-50%
   - 51-75%
   - 76-100%

.. raw:: html

   </details>

The majority of respondents (73.5% in 2023, almost exactly the same proportion as in 2022) reported that documentation makes up both their whole official job description, and most or all of their day-to-day tasks (87.2% reporting more than 51% of their daily workload). The portion of respondents performing documentation-related tasks even though it's not part of their job description remained steady.

Job changes
===========

In the 2022 survey results, we saw more employee respondents in new positions - jobs that they'd held for less than one year - than in any previous survey. To better explore how the job market shake-up of the past few years is affecting our community - both employees and contractors - we added this new section for job changes.

Employment or contract status change
------------------------------------

.. raw:: html
   
   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| Employees:

   Has your employment status changed in the past year? 
   
   - Yes
   - No

   Examples of an employment status change: you left a job; were promoted, laid off, made redundant or terminated; you started a new role.

   What are the circumstances of your employment status change? Check all that apply.

   - I was promoted within the same organization
   - I moved to another position within the same organization
   - I started a new position in a new organization
   - I was made redundant, downsized or laid off due to restructuring/bankruptcy/closure
   - My employment was terminated for another reason
   - I resigned in order to accept another offer of employment
   - I resigned, but not to accept another offer of employment
   - I would rather not say
   - Other (please specify)

   Contractors:

   Has your contract/freelance status changed in the past year? 

   - Yes
   - No

   Examples of a contract/freelance status change: a contract or project cancelled prematurely; your regular freelance workload dried up unexpectedly; you started a new contract.

   What are the circumstances of your contract/freelance status change? Check all that apply.

   - I started a new contract or freelance project (or multiple projects)
   - A contract or freelance project ended prematurely
   - A contract or freelance project ended as expected
   - My contract was not renewed as expected
   - I resigned in order to start another contract
   - I resigned, but not to start another contract
   - I "fired" a freelance client
   - My freelance work pipeline dried up
   - I left employment in order to start as a contractor/freelancer
   - I finished contracting/freelancing in order to accept a position as an employee
   - I would rather not say
   - Other (please specify)

.. raw:: html

   </details>

36.5% of respondents reported undergoing a change in their employment status in the past year, with contractors reporting changes at a slightly higher rate (43%) than employees (35.9%).

Of the employees experiencing employment changes, starting a new position at a new organization was the most reported change (46%). 28.8% were promoted within the same organization.

Of the contractors, having a contract or project ending prematurely was the most reported change (41%). 35.3% started a new contract.

   |icon-question| Employees:

   What is your current job search status?

   - I'm not looking for a new position, and am not open to employment offers
   - I'm not looking for a new position, but am open to employment offers
   - I'm not looking for a new position, but expect to be within the next year
   - I'm actively looking for a new position

   Contractors: 

   What is your current contract/freelance search status?

   - I'm not looking for new contracts or freelance projects, and am not open to offers
   - I'm not looking for new contracts or freelance projects, but am open to offers
   - I'm not looking for new contracts or freelance projects, but expect to be within the next year
   - I'm actively looking for new contracts or freelance projects

.. raw:: html  

   </details>

The majority of respondents - 46.3% of employees and 38% of contractors - stated that while they were not actively looking for new positions or contracts, they were open to considering offers that might come their way. 14% of employees and 29.1% of contractors said they were actively looking for new work.

Job security and stability
--------------------------

.. raw:: html
   
   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| How would you characterize your current feelings of job security and stability, or contract/freelance income security and stability, compared to this time last year?

   - I'm less confident in my job security or contract/freelance income security than I was last year
   - My confidence level is around the same
   - I'm more confident in my job security or contract/freelance income security than I was last year

.. raw:: html

   </details>

Note: Employees and contractors who had indicated that they were currently unemployed were not shown this question. 

Just over half of all respondents (54.1%) reported feeling the same level of job security and stability, compared to the previous year. 30.5% felt less secure, and only 15.4% felt more secure. The difference in responses between employees and contractors for this question was not significantly different.

Job offer considerations
------------------------

.. raw:: html
   
   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| When considering an offer of employment, how important do you consider the following 13 factors? 
   
   The options for each were: not relevant, not very important, somewhat important, very important.

   - Salary
   - Benefits (i.e. paid vacation, pension, insurance etc)
   - Hours and flexibility
   - Workload and responsibilities
   - Career advancement opportunities
   - Professional development opportunities
   - Work location (remote/on-site/hybrid)
   - Management/team/co-workers
   - Organization's reputation, financial standing/stability, and job security
   - Organization's culture
   - Organization's community involvement
   - Organization's pay transparency policy
   - Organization's diversity/inclusivity policy

.. raw:: html

   </details>

Note: This question - new for 2023 - was only shown to employees. 

While some obvious factors were given high importance by most respondents - salary, work location, hours, and benefits - other factors resulted in more varied results. The only factor that the majority of respondents agreed was not very important was community involvement. Stability, diversity, professional development, career advancement and pay transparency were all found to be "somewhat important" by the majority of respondents, but for all of these factors there was a wide range of variations in the responses.

Workplace
=========

The questions in this section relate to respondents' workplace: whether they work from home, from an office, or a combination, and how they feel about that. We were also interested in how the much-discussed "back to the office" mandates have affected our community. 

.. container:: note

   .. rubric:: |icon-info| Note on use of the term "remote"

   In previous surveys, this was some confusion as to the definition of the term "remote", as many people suddenly forced to work from home due to the pandemic did not think of that situation as working remotely. To clarify, we consider the word "remote" to have the same meaning as "work from home" or "home office".

Work location
-------------

.. raw:: html
   
   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| What is your current work location?

   - I am required to be on-site full time
   - I am on-site full time, but it is not required
   - I am partially on-site, and partially remote (hybrid)
   - I am fully remote, but it is by choice (i.e. an office location is available to me)
   - I am fully remote, and it is required (i.e. no office location is available to me)

   How do you feel about your work location?

   - Very negative
   - Negative
   - Neutral
   - Positive
   - Very Positive

.. raw:: html

   </details>

The majority of respondents reported working remotely, with the number doing so by choice (36.2%) higher than the number required to do so by their employer (29%).

"Return to office" (RTO) mandates
---------------------------------

.. container:: note

   .. rubric:: |icon-info| Note on use of the term "post-pandemic"

   The survey questions originally included the term "post-pandemic" to describe "return to office" mandates. However, as was correctly pointed out by several community members, the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, and is still very much a concern for at-risk groups. Removing this term does not alter the meaning or intention of the question and so has been left out of this report. 

.. raw:: html
   
   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| Has your organization implemented a "return to office" policy - requesting or requiring that remote or "work from home" employees return to working on-site?

   - Yes, it's required all of the time
   - Yes, it's required but only part of the time (hybrid work is ok)
   - Yes, it's encouraged but not mandatory
   - Yes, but only for some roles
   - No, remote work is still allowed/encouraged/required

Those who reported being affected by an RTO policy were asked about their feelings on the situation. 

Those who were required to return to the office on a part-time basis were quite evenly split between neutral (32.9%), negative (26%) and very negative (22%). Those who were positive (14.6%) or very positive (4.5%) were in the minority.

Those who reported that a return was being encouraged by not required were less negative overall - 41% reported "neutral", with the remainder split evenly between positive and negative. 

Those affected by a full time RTO mandate felt predominantly negative, with only 3 individuals reporting positive feelings.

Employee salary, benefits and satisfaction
==========================================

To protect the privacy of our community, we do not publish median salary figures for any region or category with less than 10 respondents. In previous years, this has meant that median salaries could only be given for a few regions and countries, and a handful of US states.     

With this year's survey amassing the highest number of submissions yet, we can now provide a more extensive range of salary breakdowns. Alongside the baseline data for Africa, which encompasses respondents from South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria, we have gathered enough data to publish median salaries (|50th| percentile) for 15 individual countries, 17 US states, 3 Canadian provinces (including separate figures for each province's capital city), and 3 Australian states.

In regions or categories meet the minimum threshold of 30 respondents, we're also providing the |25th| percentile (the value below which 25% of the data falls) and |75th| percentile (the value below which 75% of the data falls).

   |icon-question| Would you prefer to enter your salary as a yearly or monthly amount?

.. raw:: html

   </details>

In some locations, it is customary to discuss salary as a yearly figure, while in other it is more common to talk about monthly salaries. Respondents were asked to specify if they were entering a yearly or monthly figure, and all monthly salaries were multiplied by 12 to allow for comparison. In total, 81.1% of employee respondents chose to enter their salary as a yearly figure, with 18.9% choosing monthly.

   </details>

As in previous years, salaries for those working part-time hours (less than 30 per week) have been omitted from the figures in this section. The median salaries are based on 922 full-time employee respondents.  


.. container:: note

   .. rubric:: |icon-info| Definition of percentile values

   Previous survey results have only reported the median salary - the number in the middle of the range, sometimes referred to as the |50th| percentile. Due to the increase in numbers and finer-grained location data, we're able this year to also publish figures for the |25th| and |75th| percentile figures, for regions where there are more than 30 respondents. 

   In the following tables, the following definitions apply:

   - |25th| percentile: one quarter of all respondents earned less, three quarters earned more
   - |50th| percentile (median): half of all respondents earned more, half earned less
   - |75th| percentile: one quarter of all respondents earned more, three  quarters earned less

Median salary by respondent region
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given the range of socio-economic differences in the countries in the survey results, median salary figures broken down by country of residence of employee is more useful than overall median salary.

Median salary by gender identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to numbers, we are only able to break down salary by gender identity for women (59.9% of all respondents) and men (34.7% of all respondents). In almost every region, men earned more than women, by as much as 76% in Asia - although with such a small sample size that is unlikely to be truly representative. 

The only region where the median for women was higher was North America overall - but even here, the 75th percentile salary was higher for men, and when looking at the two largest countries in that region (the United States and Canada) men were paid more overall.

   .. rubric:: |icon-info| Differences in international labor laws

   In nearly all countries outside the US, the law ensures that employees receive paid vacation time and sick leave, with many also requiring pension contributions and/or offering paid parental leave. Likewise, many countries provide some level of universal health care, eliminating the necessity for employer-provided health coverage. To make this clearer, we asked respondents to indicate only those benefits — vacation time, health insurance, pension plans, and parental leave — that are in excess of the legal requirements in their country of residence.

Factors affecting salary satisfaction
-------------------------------------

35.1% of employee respondents - the largest group - said that they had no reasons for dissatisfaction with their salary and benefits. The next most-selected option was "salary is too low", with 30.5%.

As a result of 5 submissions in the "other" category, a new factor was added to these results, "No raises or adjustments for inflation", which will be included as an option for this question in 2024. It's worth noting that had this option been included in the question, other respondents may have selected it, so it's possible that this factor is affecting the industry more than these results would suggest.

Contract rates and satisfaction
===============================

.. container:: note

   .. rubric:: |icon-info| Note on median rates for contractors

   While the 2023 survey results include more contractors than in any previous year (79) this number is too low, and the respondents too geographically diverse, to determine median rates except for the very largest regions (the United States and Europe). Numbers are provided where possible, but it should be noted that the sample size is not large enough to provide meaningful insight. 

   For example, out of the 58 hourly rates entered, the highest value is 57 times higher than the lowest value. Even when only examining data for the United States, where 27 hourly rates were entered, the highest rate is 44 times higher than the lowest rate. Trying to segment these values further - by region, type of role, gender etc - results in numbers far too low to publish.

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| What's your preferred term to describe the kind of work you do?

   - I consider myself a contractor
   - I consider myself a freelancer
   - I consider myself self-employed
   - I prefer a different term (please specify)

.. raw:: html

   </details>

For the first time this year, we asked those respondents who are not employees what term they use to describe the kind of work they do. 53.2% term themselves "contractors", while 27.8% prefer "self-employed" and 16.5% use "freelancer". Of those who chose "other", the two terms added were "agency" and "consultant".

Several contractor respondents indicated that they were contractors by necessity rather than choice, taking contracts either because they were unable to find a suitable employment offer, or anticipating an employment offer after a period of contracting.

Fee structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Comparing payment rates for contractors is difficult due to the number of different ways that individuals in this group operate. To simplify this as much as possible while still allowing comparisons, contractors were asked to estimate their hourly rate, day rate or monthly rate - or one of each type of rate, if appropriate - even if they normally used a different fee structure. Contractors charging multiple rates or in multiple currencies were asked to enter their most common rate, or an average if they felt that was more representative.  

The hourly rate was the most popular option, utilized by 73.4% of respondents (and exclusively by 41.8%). Next was monthly rates, entered by 43% of respondents (exclusively by 20.3%). Day rates were entered by 38% of respondents, but only exclusively by 6.3%.

41.8% of respondents entered a figure for all three fee structures. 8.9% entered both hourly and day rates, and there were no respondents entering only hourly and monthly, or only daily and monthly figures. 

Median hourly rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The median hourly rate across all regions (from 58 respondents) was USD $53. Drilling down to North America (34 respondents), that rises to USD $55, and this number stays the same when examining the United States only (27 respondents). 

Looking at Europe, the median hourly rate was USD $33 (19 respondents). No further splits are possible in this region. 

Median day rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The median day rate across all regions (30 respondents) was USD $447. Looking at North America only (12 respondents), this goes up to USD $465, and in the United States only (10 respondents) to USD $480.  

Looking only at Europe (13 respondents), the median day rate was USD $242.

Median monthly rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The median monthly rate across all regions (34 respondents) was USD $4,168. There were not enough monthly rate values entered to publish a figure for North America or the United States, but examining Europe only (20 respondents) the median was USD $3,519. No further breakdowns are possible.

Pay transparency
================

Organizations with pay transparency are open about salaries and benefits for existing and prospective employees and contractors. Due to feedback from contractors in 2022, pay transparency questions were only shown to employee respondents. 

.. container:: note

   .. rubric:: |icon-info| Pay transparency legislation

   A number of US states have made some level of pay transparency law - Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Nevada, Rhode Island, Washington, California and New York - and a number of others are considering doing so. The exact requirements, level of compliance and enforcement mechanisms vary from state to state, and as most laws have only been enacted recently, it will take some time for the effects to be felt. An overview is available here: `Quick facts about state salary range transparency laws <https://www.americanprogress.org/article/quick-facts-about-state-salary-range-transparency-laws/>`_

   Additionally, The European Parliament approved a new Pay Transparency Directive in March 2023. EU member states have three years to enact legislation based on the directive. Part of the directive involves measuring and eliminating any gender-based pay discrepancies. More information is available here: `Commission welcomes the political agreement on new EU rules for pay transparency <https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7739>`_


Official pay transparency policy
--------------------------------

.. raw:: html
   
   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| Is there an official pay transparency policy at your organization?

   - Yes - compensation is disclosed for all roles, levels, and job listings to all employees and candidates
   - Yes - but disclosure is limited to certain roles, levels, candidacy or employment status, or location
   - Yes - the policy forbids disclosure on compensation
   - No - there is no policy on compensation disclosure
   - I am not sure

.. raw:: html

   </details>

52.2% of respondents reported that there was no official pay transparency policy at their organization, and 23.9% were unsure. These numbers are almost exactly the same as last year, which was the first time that this question was included. 

9.8% of organizations had a partial policy, and 6.8% had a full open pay transparency (slightly up from 5.3% last year). 7.2% had a policy forbidding any pay disclosure, which is slightly down from 9% last year.

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| Regardless of official policy, is there a culture of sharing salary information at your organization?

Organization demographics
=========================

This section concerns employing organizations. Contractors were asked to either answer about the main organization they work for, or a typical/respresentative organization, whichever felt most appropriate to them.

Organization size
-----------------

.. raw:: html
   
   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| What is the approximate size of your organization, in number of employees?

   - Less than 10
   - 11 - 50
   - 51 - 100
   - 101 - 1000
   - 1001 - 10,000
   - 10,001 - 100,000
   - More than 100,000

.. raw:: html

As in previous years, medium-sized organizations make up the largest proportion of the results. When separating the employee respondents from the contractor respondents, a different pattern emerges - contractors are generally spread much more evenly between small, medium and large organizations.

Respondents who selected software development or software development tools were asked to also select the industries that the software product or service created by the organization primarily caters to, if possible. For example, e-learning software would also be categorized as "Education, Training" and point of sale software for restaurants would also be "Food, Beverages". 

The majority of organizations represented in the results - 94.8% - were for-profit businesses or corporations rather than non-profit, community, political, educational or government organizations, or NGOs.

Based on feedback and "other" entries for industry, the final list of industries has been adjusted for the final results. One entirely new industry group has been added - Parks, Recreation, Nature, Wildnerness, Outdoors, Conservation, Ecotourism - and several others have had their definitions expanded.

69.3% of respondents chose a single industry from the list, and 20% selected two, and 6% selected three different industries.

Respondent demographics
=======================

Who makes up the Write the Docs community? The questions in this section on respondent age, gender identity, education, experience, and location provide context for the salary/rate and satisfaction data. All questions in this section had an "I'd rather not say" option, with the exception of geographical location (country and state or province only), without which the core objective of the survey cannot be achieved.

The age group split was very neat this year - approximately one third of respondents were in the 26-35 year old age group, and another third were in the 36-45 year old age group. The remaining third were mostly in the older groups - 46-55, 56-65, and 66+ - although 3.2% fell into the 18-25 year old group and 1.2% chose not to supply an answer.

   - Rural area (low population density, ≤5000 people)
   - Town or suburban area (medium population density, ≤50,000 people)
   - City or urban area (high population density, >50,000 people)

   City/Town (optional): 

.. raw:: html

   </details>

While most questions in this section were optional, general geographical location was not - this is because without country and state/province/region, we cannot calculate regional median salaries, which is one of the main objectives of the survey. For privacy reasons, finer-grained geographical location is optional.

The majority of respondents - 70.3% - reported living in a city or urban area, with 23.7% in a town or suburban (semi-dense) location and only 6% living in a rural area.

Survey feedback
===============

For the first time this year, we included a mini "meta-survey" - a handful of questions about the survey itself.  

.. raw:: html
   
   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| Have you participated in a WTD Salary Survey before?

   How would you rate the following three aspects of the survey? Options given for each were: excellent, good, OK, not great, no opinion.

   - Relevance of the questions
   - Usability of the survey form and website
   - Length of the survey

.. raw:: html

   </details>

More than half of the 2023 respondents - 58.2% - were first-time WTD Salary Survey participants. 

Regarding the relevance of the questions, 52.2% rated them "excellent", and another 38.8% thought they were "good". 7.7% felt they were just "OK", and only 0.5% chose "not great". 0.8% chose not to share an opinion. 

Concerning the usability of the survey form and website, over half rated it "excellent", with another 28.8% rating it "good". 6.1% chose "ok", 1.1% thought it was "no great" and 0.5% had no opinion. 

The length of the survey has been an area of concern for the survey team, so we were quite relieved to find that 80.3% of respondents said that the length was "just right". However, a significant proportion - 13.6% - were of the opinion that the survey was too long (and another 1.2% chose "far too long") so this is something we will take into consideration in future surveys. 4% had no opinion and a very small percentage of survey fans (0.8%) said that it was "too short".
