Introduction
------------

The Write the Docs Salary Survey aims to gather data about salaries for
documentarians across the world, to help our community members determine
what appropriate salary ranges are, and to provide a benchmark for
future negotiations.

In the second annual survey, which was open from mid-August until
mid-November 2020, we incorporated community feedback from the first
survey and revised the wording of some questions to reduce ambiguity. We
expanded the scope to better cater for independent contractors, people
who were currently out of work, and multiple currencies, and also added
a section about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

805 people completed the survey in 2020, an increase of 24% over 2019.

This year, while our respondents specified the currency they were paid
in, all numbers in this report have been converted to US dollars for
ease of comparison, and the actual exchange rate used has been noted.

Section 1: Employment Parameters
---------------------------------

In this section, we asked about the parameters of the respondent’s
employment: 

-  whether they were employees, self-employed, or had been employed or
   self-employed but were currently not working, 
-  the number of hours they worked and the length of time they had held
   the same position, 
-  whether they worked solo or as part of a team and how they classified
   their role, and
-  how focused their role was on tasks related to documentation.

In 2019, respondents were asked if they were employees or independent
operators (contractors, freelancers, self-employed). In 2020, we
included new options for those who were not currently working at the
time of taking the survey. These respondents were asked to answer the
questions as if they were still in their previous employment or contract
situation, and their data is included in this report as such.

18 employees and 2 independent contractors filled out the survey on this
basis, or 2.5% of all respondents.

The ratios of employees to independent contractors stayed almost
identical: 93% of respondents were employees (versus 94% in 2019) while
the remaining 7% (versus 6% in 2019) were independent contractors,
freelance operators or self-employed.

question (versus 207 in 2019). Only one respondent did not provide a
valid job title.

The most common job title entered was “Technical Writer”, making up 33%
of all respondents - but nearly double that (63% of respondents) entered
job titles that included that phrase.

In 2019, we attempted to illustrate the range of roles in the community
by analyzing job titles and grouping them by keyword. In 2020, we went
straight to the source and asked respondents to broadly categorize their
role themselves.

The majority of respondents (87.7%) placed themselves primarily in the
writer/creator/producer/editor role, with management coming in next at
4.8% followed by developer/engineer at 3.4%.

Support, educator, advocate/community outreach and marketing each had
single digit representation. 20 respondents (2.5%) chose “Other” and
entered a different categorization: these included information
architecture, analysis, content strategy, knowledge management and
product management.

Respondents were further asked to indicate if they worked primarily solo,
as part of a team (either a team made up of people doing the same kind
of job, or a multi-disciplinary team), as part of multiple teams, or as
a manager or team leader.

-  16.3% of respondents indicated that they work solo, a decrease from
   2019 (where nearly 30% reported working alone),
-  52.9% worked on a single team,
-  17% on multiple teams, and
-  13.3% lead a team.

4 respondents selected “Other” and entered more information: 3 of these
were special cases but essentially each worked as part of a team or
multiple teams, while the final case indicated a solo role.

Due to ambiguous wording, this question caused some confusion in 2019
with some respondents possibly entering the length of time they had been
working in documentation (which is covered in the demographics section)
rather than the amount of time working with their current employer.
Improved wording and additional clarification this year cleared this up.

Up until the 5 year mark, the numbers were split quite evenly:

-  26% of respondents had been in their current role for less than one
   year,
-  26.2% for between 1 and 2 years, and
-  29.2% for between 2 and 5 years - accounting for 81.3% of the total.

13.2% had been with their current employer for between 5 and 10 years,
and the remaining 5.5% (44 individual respondents) for more than 10
years.

Of those respondents who had been with their current employer for more
than 10 years,

-  61% reported between 11 and 15 years,
-  10 individual respondents indicated 20 years or more -  7 of these
   had clocked up either 20 or 21 years, and
-  single respondents each reported 23 years, 27 years, and 28 years.

69.6% of respondents reported that documentation was the whole of their
official job description, and 25.6% reported that it was only one part.

3.4% reported that documentation was not part of their official job
description but that they were still expected to perform
documentation-related tasks, and 1.5% stated that although documentation
was not part of their job description and they were not expected to
perform documentation-related tasks, they did anyway.

These overall proportions remain essentially unchanged from 2019’s
results.

Section 2: Work Location and COVID-19
-------------------------------------

In 2019, we included one question about work location: whether the
respondent worked on site, remotely, or a combination of the two; the
possible responses were arranged to also show if the work location was
stipulated by the employer or the individual’s own choice.

We found that 56% of respondents worked completely on site, more than
half of them by choice, and 17% worked completely remotely, three
quarters of them by choice. The remaining 27% split their time between
onsite and remote work.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused huge upheavals in the way that we
work, particularly with regard to work location, so this question was
converted into a whole new section.

Work Location Changes due to COVID-19
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
80% of respondents said that their work location had changed, either
permanently or temporarily, due to COVID-19.

Note: a small number of respondents answered “yes” to the question of
whether their work location had changed due to COVID-19, but then
selected the same option for work location before and after/since the
pandemic. These responses were filtered out of the table below but not
out of the rest of the figures for this section, as we assumed that
“yes, things have changed” was the significant response, and the options
presented for remote and onsite work perhaps did not account for all the
subtleties of work location that are possible.

Overwhelmingly and unsurprisingly, the bulk of the changes reported are
from working on-site to working remote.

Of those reporting changes, nearly half (48.5%) had previously been
required to be on-site. Of those respondents, 50% were now required to
be remote, 35% were given the option to work remotely, and another 11.5%
were now partially onsite and partially remote. Only 3% were now working
onsite.

Respondents who indicated that they had experienced a work location
change due to COVID-19 were asked if they thought that the changes would
be permanent or temporary, and also how they felt about the change.

Opinions on the permanency of the changes were quite evenly spread -
however those who predicted “no” (25.4%) or “probably no” (22.2%) - a
combined 47.6% - outweighed those that predicted “yes” (13.2%) or
“probably yes” (22.9%) - a combined 36.1%.

While other aspects of living through a pandemic might be challenging, a
large proportion of respondents reported finding a silver lining in work
location changes. More than 60% of respondents reported feeling
“positive” (34.11%) or “very positive” (26.51%) about the change, 27.29%
felt “neutral”, and only 12.09% reported feeling “negative” (11.47%) or
“very negative” (0.62%, or 4 individuals).

Work Location Unchanged
'''''''''''''''''''''''

Of those respondents (20%) who indicated that their work location had
not changed due to COVID-19, 45% were required to be remote, 38.7% were
remote by choice, and 6.3% were partially onsite and partially remote.
Only 10% (16 individuals) worked onsite, either by choice (5%) or
necessity (5%).

In response to their feelings about their work location, of the 83.8%
that worked remotely, 67.9% reported feeling “very positive” and 24.6%
reported “positive”. 10 individuals (7.5%) were “neutral” about their
work location, and no remote workers in this group felt at all negative
about the situation.

Similarly, no negativity was reported from the 16 respondents in this
group who worked on-site. Half of the on-site workers felt “very
positive” and the other half were split between “positive” and
 “neutral”. In fact, only 1 respondent - from the “partially remote,
partially onsite” segment - reported feeling “negative” about their work
location, and no one reported feeling “very negative”.

Overall Work Location
'''''''''''''''''''''

Combining the results for respondents whose work location has changed
with those whose location has not gives a snapshot of the work location
of the whole community, both before the pandemic started and in the
latter half of 2020.

What comes out is - again, unsurprisingly - a complete reversal: prior
to the pandemic, more than half of respondents (58.26%) worked in
offices, but since COVID-19 that number has shrunk to only 3.6%. Remote
workers made up 20.62% of the pre-COVID-19 workforce; whereas the
pandemic has moved 87.7% of workers to remote.

8.9% of respondents gave additional information about other changes they
had experienced. These included:

Changes related to salary and benefits:

-  Salary cuts - both permanent and temporary
-  Raises and bonuses postponed or cancelled
-  Benefits reduced (e.g. 401k matching, commuting benefits)
-  Salaries paid late

Changes related to workload:

-  Reductions in the amount of work available
-  Increased workload
-  Increased overtime
-  More time required for people and project management
-  Increased oversight on productivity and time tracking

Changes related to personnel:

-  Hiring freezes and upcoming contracts cancelled
-  Team reorganizations and company restructures

Changes related to travel and events:

-  Work travel cancelled
-  In-person training, workshops, summits etc cancelled or shifted
   online

Some respondents called out positive changes: remote workers in
companies who felt disadvantaged compared to their onsite colleagues
found the playing field levelled as everyone was forced to work from
home; others found themselves growing professionally as they took on new
responsibilities. Several reported being able to get more done in their
new work location, although missing social interaction with colleagues
was seen as a downside by some.

Section 3: Salary Information
-----------------------------

In 2019, as well as the all-important salary figure and a list of
benefits, we asked for the respondent’s level of satisfaction with their
salary and job, and if relevant, their reasons for dissatisfaction.

Upon reviewing the responses, it became apparent that we had
over-simplified a complex concept. Level of satisfaction with salary and
level of satisfaction with a job overall are often separate and distinct
- it is entirely possible to be extremely satisfied with every aspect of
a position other than the salary, and the reverse can also be true.

In 2020, we separated these two aspects - salary satisfaction and
overall job satisfaction - as well as providing a new section designed
for contractors, freelancers and independent operators with different
options for payment models (hourly rates, daily rates etc). Respondents
(both employees and independent contractors) were also able to specify
the currency that they were paid in.

   30% is automatically withheld by their employer for income tax.

   plus 30%).

Notes
^^^^^

As over 95% of respondents reporting working between 30 and 80 hours per
week - a “full time” role - those reporting fewer than 30 hours have been
omitted from the figures in this section.

While the survey specifically requested annual salary, a number of
respondents entered monthly salary. Where it was obvious that this is
what had occurred, the numbers were multiplied by 12 for the result
sets. There were 4 individual results where we could not be certain if
the salary figure was monthly or if a currency notation error had been
made, so these results were omitted from this section.

The following figures are therefore based on a reduced result set of 729
full-time employees.

Overall Median Salary - Employees
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The median salary across all regions, before tax and any additional
benefits, was USD $80,000 (meaning half of the respondents earned more,
and half earned less).

This figure does not take into account the socio-economic situation in
the countries of the very highest earners (the top 10 salaries were all
from the United States) and the very lowest (the bottom 10 salaries were
from Asia and South America) - as well as the difference between the
country of the employee and the country of the employer. Figures grouped
into regions make a more useful baseline from which to determine what
constitutes a “fair” salary.

Currencies
^^^^^^^^^^

Respondents reported being paid in a total of 31 different currencies. Where the location country of the respondent and the location country of the employer organization were different, in most cases the respondent was paid in the currency of their location country (possibly for legal reasons, in many cases). There were 21 individual exceptions to this rule, with some respondents located in Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Belarus, Canada, Argentina, Vietnam and Colombia being paid in the currency of their employer's country.

employees are entitled to paid vacation time and paid sick leave by law,
and many also mandate pension contributions and/or paid parental leave.
Similarly, many countries have universal health care, negating the need
for employer-provided health cover. To make this clearer, in 2020 we
asked respondents to only check the boxes for vacation time, health
insurance, pension plans and parental leave if their employee benefit
was in excess of what was required by law in the country where they
live.

The notes for this question clarified that respondents who work in IT
and software should choose the industry that their organization
services, after some confusion around this question in our 2019 survey.
While IT and software still accounted for the largest share of responses
- 36.3% - the spread of other industries gave a clearer picture of the
range of organizations employing documentarians in our community.

Telecommunications came in next at 15.2%, followed by Finance at 8.3%.
The next set of industries - Health, Professional Services, Security,
Advertising, Manufacturing, and Retail - each made up between 2% and 5%
of responses.

Education, Transport, Aerospace/Defence, Entertainment, Government,
Automotive, Construction and Utilities each accounted for between 10 and
15 responses each. Travel, Food, Science, Insurance, Non-Profit, Media,
Real Estate, Agriculture and Legal were selected by under 10 respondents
each.

The “Other” category was selected by 37 respondents. In all cases, the
entered field could be mapped to one of the categories listed.

In 2019, 58% of survey respondents who provided a location were based in
the United States. As the Write the Docs community is international, one
of our aims for 2020 was to try and expand the reach of the survey to
documentarians in more countries, in order to make the results more
comprehensive.

In 2020, we had some success with this: while the number of US residents
increased slightly (373 individuals versus 350 in 2019), this only made
up 46% of the total number of responses, meaning that the 24% increase
in total survey reach was largely from our international community.

While the number of respondents from Canada and Germany decreased, there
were significant increases in responses from Australia, Brazil, India,
Israel, Poland and Ukraine.

No responses were recorded in 2020 from Bulgaria, Greece, Iceland,
Italy, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore or Slovakia - all of which were
represented in 2019. Bangladesh, Belarus, Colombia, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Kenya, Mexico, Pakistan, South Africa, South Korea and Switzerland
appeared as new countries in the result set.
