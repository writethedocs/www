Documentation Salary Survey 2024 Results
****************************************

Introduction
============

This sixth incarnation of the Write the Docs Salary Survey drew **779 responses from documentarians in 55 countries**. As always, we are impressed by the skills, experience and diversity of the Write the Docs community, and are grateful to everyone who took the time to fill out the survey and share it with their co-workers.

.. tip::

   **In a hurry?** Jump straight to `Median salary`_ or `Median rates`_.

Feedback

   .. rubric:: Your comments

   Here's some of our favourite comments from 2024: 

   .. pull-quote::

      I used the results of this survey to ask for a raise a few years ago. It helped enormously - I got the most significant raise I've ever received!

      I negotiated a much higher salary bracket when hiring a new team member. Other (paid) salary calibrators don't have enough info for tech writers and the 'AI' estimates are always too low.

      Data from past years helped me understand how underpaid I was at the time and gave me confidence to negotiate with the next opportunity.

      In 2025, I expect to convert from a contractor to a full-time employee. I fully expect that I will need to negotiate my salary and will lean heavily on the WTD Salary Survey to do so.

   .. rubric:: Contractors, freelancers and self-employed people

   We asked those who filled out the survey as independent contractors, freelancers or self-employed people what term they used to describe their type of employment. More than half (63.8%) preferred the term “contractor”, with only 18.1% using “freelancer” and 10.6% using “self-employed”. In this report, we’ll use the term “contractors” to refer to this entire group.

As in previous surveys, employees made up the majority of respondents (686, or 87.9%). Contractors made up 8.5% (66 individuals).

For the first time this year, we included a third option - for respondents who had worked in the past year as both employee and contractor. 28 respondents (3.6%) chose this option, and provided both salary and contract rate data. This means that in total there are 714 employee responses and 94 contractor responses (the highest number of contractor responses yet).

.. [*] Includes 28 employee-contractor respondents who are counted twice - once as an employee and once as a contractor

As in previous years, we encouraged those currently not working to respond as though still at their previous job/contract, provided they had worked at least some of the past year. 16 employees (2.3%) and 7 contractors (10.6%) filled out the survey on this basis.

Of the 28 respondents who had worked as both employee and contractor in the past year, 15 were currently working in both capacities. The others were currently working as one or the other only, or not working at all (2 respondents).

   <details><summary>Question background</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-info| 
   
   Given that job titles and the responsibilities they entail varies widely, this question attempts to add context to the salary data by identifying the type of work being primarily performed.

   We added the original version of this question - which asked respondents to broadly categorize their role into one of a limited set of options - in the second survey, in 2020. Starting in 2022, we allowed respondents to choose multiple role categories. This highlighted the breadth of talent in our community, but made comparing salaries more difficult.

   After community consultation in 2024, we split this question into two parts - one for primary role category, and one for additional roles - and expanded the number of options.

.. raw:: html

   </details>

Primary role category
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Technical writer" was by far the most widely-selected primary role category, chosen by 83.7% of respondents. "Editor", "DocOps" and "project/product manager" counted for around 2% each. 

7 respondents selected "other" and provided more detail: most were all-rounders who performed a combination of roles, although "content strategist", "communications writer" and "rebranding tech" were also mentioned.

Additional role categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

45 respondents (5.8%) chose only a primary role category. Of these, 42 listed "technical writer" as their primary role category, 2 selected "editor" and 1 selected "developer or engineer".

Of the respondents who selected additional role categories, the number chosen ranged from 1 (82 respondents) to 10 or more (32 respondents). The most popular number of additional role categories was 3, with 136 respondents selecting 3 additional categories.

This resulted in an incredibly diverse range of primary and secondary role category combinations - over 3,400 in all.

A spike in respondents with new jobs was first seen in 2021, with 31.7% of respondents reported being in their current position at their current organization for less than a year. In 2022, this number peaked at 36.8% - when respondents with new jobs outstripped the number who had held their current position for medium or long terms. In 2023, the number of respondents with new jobs fell again, to 20.3% - lower than in 2020 although still well above the 9% reported in 2019, and this number has remained steady in 2024, at 21.8%.

Salary or contract earnings changes
-----------------------------------

.. raw:: html

   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question|

   **EMPLOYEES:**

   **Has your salary changed in the past year?** Please do not take outside factors such as inflation, cost of living or currency conversion rates into account - just the actual amount of compensation you receive.

   - Yes - my salary increased
   - Yes - my salary decreased
   - No - my salary stayed the same

   **CONTRACTORS:**

   **Have your total contract or freelance earnings changed in the past year?** Please do not take outside factors such as inflation, cost of living or currency conversion rates into account - just the total amount of money you received from work you have done in the past year.

   - Yes - my earnings increased
   - Yes - my earnings decreased
   - No - my earnings stayed the same

   <details><summary>Question background</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-info| 
   
   In the 2022 survey results, we saw more employee respondents in new positions - jobs that they'd held for less than one year - than in any previous survey. To better explore how the job market shake-up of the past few years is affecting our community - both employees and contractors - we added this new section for job changes in 2023.

   After community input in 2024, we changed the format of the question to ask about salary or earnings changes directly, rather than asking about changes in employment or contract status. We also added a question about whether respondents had attempted to negotiate a salary increase in the past year, regardless of the outcome.

.. raw:: html

   </details>

Of the 713 respondents who worked as employees in the past year, 75% reported that their salary had increased in the past year. 22.3% reported no change, and 2.7% reported a decrease.

Among the 94 respondents who had worked on a contract basis, only 46.8% reported an earnings increase. 37.2% reported no change, and 16% reported a decrease.

Reasons for salary increase or decrease
---------------------------------------

.. raw:: html

   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question|

   **Why did your salary increase?** Select multiple, if appropriate.

   - I received or negotiated a raise
   - I was promoted within the same organization
   - I moved to another position within the same organization
   - I started a new position in a new organization
   - Other (please specify)

   OR

   **Why did your salary decrease?** Select multiple, if appropriate.

   - Organizational salary cuts
   - I was made redundant, downsized or laid off due to restructuring/bankruptcy/closure
   - My employment was terminated
   - I resigned
   - I moved to another position with the same organization at a lower salary
   - I started a new position in a new organization at a lower salary
   - Other (please specify)

   **Regardless of outcome, did you attempt to negotiate a salary increase in the past year?** This could be through formal or informal procedures.

   - yes
   - no

.. raw:: html

   </details>

61.6% of employees reporting an increase in salary attributed this to a raise. 17.4% received a promotion, and 13.9% started a new position.

After examining the responses entered by those respondents who selected "Other" and provided more detail, four additional options were added to the reasons for salary increase:

- "Adjustment" refers to a salary increase to account for inflation, cost-of-living increases, currency exchange rates or similar - rather than a performance, merit or tenure-based raise;
- "Position change" refers to a change in location, increase in responsibilities or wider scope of tasks that warranted a salary increase, without actually being a promotion or lateral move;
- "Equity" refers to the maturation of stock options or other equity-based compensation increases; and
- "Bonus" refers to a one-time or annual bonus payment that was not part of the respondent's regular salary.

50% of employees reporting a decrease in salary attributed this to starting a new position at a lower salary. 20.8% were made redundant, 12.5% experienced organizational salary cuts, and 8.3% had their employment terminated.

There was only one "other" response for salary decrease, representing a potentially common option which was added:

-  "Relocation" refers to a decrease in salary due to a move to a location with a lower cost of living or lower salary expectations.

32.8% of employees attempted to negotiate a salary increase in the past year.

.. container:: question

   |icon-question|

   **Why did your contract or freelance earnings increase?** Select multiple, if appropriate.

   - I started a new contract or freelance project (or multiple projects)
   - I raised my rate
   - I worked more hours
   - Other (please specify)

   OR

   **Why did your contract or freelance earnings decrease?** Select multiple, if appropriate.

   - A contract or freelance project ended prematurely
   - A contract or freelance project ended as expected
   - My contract was not renewed or extended as expected
   - I resigned from a contract or "fired" a freelance client
   - My freelance work pipeline dried up
   - I lowered my rate
   - I worked fewer hours
   - Other (please specify)

   **Regardless of outcome, did you attempt to negotiate a contract or freelance rate increase in the past year?**

   - yes
   - no

.. raw:: html

   </details>

Of those contractors reporting an increase in their earnings, 36.5% raised their rate, 34.9% started new contracts or projects, and 14.3% worked more hours.

Four additional options were added to the reasons for contract earnings increase, based on responses entered by those who selected "Other" and provided more detail:

- "Received a raise" - as distinct from "raised rate" - applies to those contractors who work a single contract in the manner of a regular employee, and received a raise from their client/employer;
- "Job changes" to describe taking on additional responsibility or work scope within the same contract, leading to an increase in earnings;
- "Bonus" for a one-off additional payment; and
- "Promotion" for a change in role or responsibility - again applying to those contractors working a single contract in the manner of a regular employee.

Of those contractors reporting a decrease in their earnings, 20% reported that their pipeline dried up, 16% worked fewer hours, and 16% had a contract end prematurely.

Two new options were added to the reasons for earnings decrease, based on responses entered by those who selected "Other":

- "Stopgap contracting" for those who took on contracts at a lower rate as a temporary measure after losing permanent employment, while searching for a new permanent position; and
- "Relocation" for those who moved to a location with a lower cost of living or lower salary expectations.

45.7% of contractors reported that they attempted to negotiate a rate increase in the past year.

Workplace
=========

The questions in this section relate to respondents' workplace: whether they work from home, from an office, or a combination, and how they feel about that. We were also interested in how the much-discussed "return to the office" (RTO) mandates have affected our community.

   .. rubric:: |icon-info| Note on use of the term "remote"

   In previous surveys, this was some confusion as to the definition of the term "remote", as many people suddenly forced to work from home due to the pandemic did not think of that situation as working remotely. To clarify, we consider the word "remote" to have the same meaning as "work from home" or "home office".

Work location

.. raw:: html

   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| 
   
   **What is your current work location?**

   - I am required to be on-site full time
   - I am on-site full time, but it is not required
   - I am partially on-site, and partially remote (hybrid)
   - I am fully remote, but it is by choice (i.e. an office location is available to me)
   - I am fully remote, and it is required (i.e. no office location is available to me)

   **How do you feel about your work location?**

   - Very negative
   - Negative
   - Neutral
   - Positive
   - Very Positive

.. raw:: html

   </details>

The vast majority of respondents (58.9%) work remotely - 30% by choice, and 28.9% by necessity. 32.3% of respondents report that they work in a hybrid environment. Those working on-site, whether by choice or necessity, make up only 8.7% of respondents.

   **Regardless of the policy at your current organization or your current situation, what is your preferred work location?**

   - I prefer to work on-site on a full-time basis
   - I prefer to work remotely/from home on a full-time basis
   - I prefer the flexibility of a hybrid work location (partly on-site, partly remote)
   - I have no strong preference / it depends on the situation

.. raw:: html

   </details>

Regardless of their current situation, 52.1% of all respondents said that their preferred work location is remote. Another 40.6% favored a hybrid model (some days in the office, some days working from home or another location). Only 2.8% said they preferred working on-site at their employer's office, and 4.5% stated no preference or that their preference depended upon the situation.

   .. rubric:: Definition of percentile values

   Throughout this report, the following definitions apply:

   - |25th| percentile: one quarter of all respondents earned less, three quarters earned more
   - |50th| percentile (median): half of all respondents earned more, half earned less
   - |75th| percentile: one quarter of all respondents earned more, three  quarters earned less

   Medians are used when comparing salary data, as they are less affected by outliers than average values. Medians are shown for any salary breakdown with at least 10 responses, and 25th and 75th percentiles are shown for breakdowns with at least 30 responses.

Median salary by respondent region
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given the range of socio-economic differences in the countries in the survey results, median salary figures broken down by country of residence of employee is more useful than overall median salary.

Median salary by gender identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to have large enough numbers for statistical significance, we only break down salary by gender identity for women (57% of all respondents) and men (37.2% of all respondents), and only in regions where there are at least 30 respondents of each gender.

This year, that means that we are able to show breakdowns for Worldwide, North America and Europe. Men earned more than women in all regions, but the difference was largest in Europe (where men earned 19.6% more than women).

Median salary by organization size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Salaries generally increase with the size of the organization, with the highest median salaries observed in organizations with more than 100,000 employees. In North America, this trend is particularly pronounced in the 75th percentile for the very largest organizations. In Europe, while the trend of increasing salaries with organization size is also evident, there's a small drop in all salary ranges in the 10,000 - 100,000 employee category.

Employee benefits
-----------------

.. raw:: html

   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| 
   
   **Does your salary package include any of the following statutory benefits?**

   Labor laws in some countries mandate that employees receive some or all of the following benefits as part of their employment (in some cases depending on the size or type of employer).

   Please indicate if you have access to any of the following statutory benefits. Check all that apply, or select "none of the above".

   - Paid vacation
   - Paid parental leave
   - Paid sick leave
   - Healthcare benefits
   - Pension / superannuation / retirement
   - None of the above

   **Does your salary package include any of the following statutory benefits, in excess of the required minimums?**

   Please indicate if you receive any of the following benefits, in excess of any government-mandated minimums that may apply, as part of your salary package. Check all that apply, or select "none of the above".

   For example, in Germany, employees are legally entitled to 20 days of paid vacation per year. An employee living in Germany who has a paid vacation allowance of 30 days would therefore select "paid vacation" for this question, as they receive more than the government mandated minimum.

   - Paid vacation
   - Paid parental leave
   - Paid sick leave
   - Healthcare benefits
   - Pension / superannuation / retirement
   - I'm not sure
   - None of the above

   **Does your salary package include any of the following non-statutory benefits?** Check all that apply, or select "none of the above".

   - Time off or bonuses for community-related activities
   - 401(k) matching or equivalent (additional pension contributions)
   - Unlimited PTO (paid/personal time off)
   - Insurance e.g. life, accident, income protection
   - Stocks, shares, stock options, or equity
   - Commission or bonus payments
   - Professional development / ongoing education / conference budget
   - Meals, meal vouchers, or food-related benefits
   - Gym, fitness, sport, or other wellness-related benefits
   - Transportation-related benefits (company car, public transport passes, parking, fuel vouchers or reimbursements for any transport-related cost)
   - Home office or co-working office budget (including for laptops or other equipment)
   - Phone and/or internet-related benefits or reimbursements
   - Other (please specify)
   - None of the above

   <details><summary>Question background</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-info|

   This question was overhauled in 2024 to distinguish between benefits that are mandated by law in the country of employment, and those that are provided by the employer in addition to what is legally required. Instead of one question asking about all benefits, we now ask three separate questions: one about statutory benefits, one about statutory benefits in excess of legal requirements, and one about non-statutory benefits.

.. raw:: html

   </details>

Statutory benefits such as paid vacation (86.3%), paid sick leave (82.2%), and healthcare benefits (76.6%) were the most commonly reported, with only 1.8% of respondents indicating they received none. 

Extra statutory benefits, such as additional paid vacation (50.2%) and enhanced healthcare benefits (41.3%), were less common, with 14.2% reporting none. 

Among non-statutory benefits, insurance (54.4%), professional development budgets (50.1%), and stock options or equity (45.3%) were the most frequently provided, while only 4.5% reported receiving none.

   <details><summary>Question background</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-info|

   This question was overhauled in 2024 to be more positive in outlook, and to capture a fuller spectrum of attitudes. Rather than asking respondents to choose from a list of factors that may affect their satisfaction, we asked them to rate their agreement with a series of statements about their salary and benefits, job, workplace, team and organization.

.. raw:: html

   </details>

While the format of this question has changed from previous years, it's possible to see patterns in the responses. For example, most respondents like and/or respect their co-workers (91.7% agreed), and to a lesser extent their managers and team leaders (79.5%) and their organization (66.9%). Many respondents are concerned with their salary not keeping up with inflation (32.6%), and a significant number are not satisfied with their workload (14.2%).

Respondents who indicated that the statement was not relevant to their situation were excluded from the analysis.

Contract rates and satisfaction
===============================

This section contains questions about the different types of contract work, rates, and feelings of satisfaction with contract work and contract earnings, as well as confidence in the current prospects for new contract work. 

To protect the privacy of our community, we do not publish median salary figures for any region or category with less than 10 respondents. In regions or categories that meet the minimum threshold of 30 respondents, we're also providing the |25th| percentile (the value below which 25% of the data falls) and |75th| percentile (the value below which 75% of the data falls). 

While the 2024 survey results include more contractor data than in any previous year (94 responses) this number is too low, and the respondents too geographically diverse, to determine median rates except for the very largest regions (the United States and Europe).

   **What's your preferred term to describe the kind of work you do?**

   |icon-info| 
   
   In the first few surveys, we often struggled with the wording to describe the group of respondents who are not employees - "contractors, freelance operators, and self-employed people" is cumbersome and doesn't really "roll off the tongue". While we often used "contractor" as a catch-all shorthand term, we were aware that this might not be the preferred term for everyone.

   In 2023, we asked respondents who are not employees what term they prefer to describe the kind of work they do. The results from that year indicated that "contractor" was the most widely-used term, so that's what we used as a shorthand term throughout 2023's results and in the survey form for 2024.

   We'll continue to ask this question in future surveys to ensure that we're using the most appropriate term.

63.8% of non-employee respondents term themselves "contractors", while 18.1% prefer "freelancer" and 10.6% use "self-employed". Of the 7 individuals who chose "other", 3 indicated that they consider themselves full time employees working under a service agreement (temporary or otherwise), 2 specified "consultant", one specified "agency worker", and the final respondent entered "N/A".

Illustrating how varied contractor working situations are, out of the 94 total contractor respondents, there were 59 different combinations of client type, contract or project type, and product or service offering.

53.2% of contractor respondents indicated that they worked exclusively for a single client at a time. Another 27.7% indicated that they worked exclusively for multiple clients at a time. 5.3% worked at times for either a single client or multiple clients, and 13.8% did not indicate whether they worked for a single client or multiple.

36.2% of contractor respondents did not specify a typical contract length, while 30.9% reported working exclusively on long-term contracts (6-12 months or longer). Mixed contract lengths were reported by 23.4%, with 7.4% working only on medium-term contracts (1-6 months) and 2.1% working exclusively on short-term contracts (days or weeks).

The majority of contractor respondents (64.9%) did not specify offering either products or services. Of those that indicated that they did, 28.7% provided specific services, 5.3% offered both products and services, and only 1.1% reported offering products.

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| 
   
   Comparing payment rates for contractors, freelancers and self-employed people is difficult due to the number of different ways that individuals in this group operate.

   To simplify this as much as possible while still allowing comparisons, please estimate one or more of the following rate types, even if you normally use a different fee structure.

   Don't include any VAT, GST or sales tax. If you normally charge different rates, enter your most common rate, or an average if you feel that is more representative.

   **My hourly rate is:** 
   
   - currency
   - rate
   
   **My day rate is:**

Median rates
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In previous years, we asked contractor respondents to enter multiple rates, if appropriate, and a number did so. This year, although the form allowed multiple rates to be entered, no respondents entered more than one type of rate.

Hourly rates were the most commonly entered fee structure, used by 66% of contractor respondents. 27.7% entered a monthly rate, and the remaining 6.4% - 6 individuals - entered a day rate. Due to the low number of day rates, we're unable to publish any median day rates.

.. container:: question

   |icon-info|

   This question was overhauled in 2024 to be more positive in outlook, and to capture a fuller spectrum of attitudes. Rather than asking respondents to choose from a list of factors that may affect their satisfaction, we asked them to rate their agreement with a series of statements about their salary and benefits, job, workplace, team and organization.

.. raw:: html

   </details>

While the format of this question has changed from previous years, it's possible to see patterns in the responses. For example, many contractors are concerned with keeping up with inflation (32.6%), and career advancement opportunities (42.1% negative).

Respondents who indicated that the statement was not relevant to their situation were excluded from the analysis.

   |icon-info|

   Pay transparency was first included in the 2022 survey. Due to feedback from contractors in this first year, pay transparency questions were only shown to employee respondents in 2023. However, as some contractors work long-term contracts for single clients in the manner of regular employees, pay transparency may still be relevant.

   In 2024, we moved the pay transparency questions from the employee salary section to the organization demographics section, as it's organization-related. Contractors were given the option of filling out this section or skipping it, depending on whether they deemed it relevant to their situation or not. The question about the legal requirement for pay transparency in the organization's location was also added.

   .. rubric:: Pay transparency legislation

   A number of US states have made some level of pay transparency law - Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Nevada, Rhode Island, Washington, California and New York - and a number of others are considering doing so. The exact requirements, level of compliance and enforcement mechanisms vary from state to state, and as most laws have only been enacted recently, it will take some time for the effects to be felt. An overview is available here: `Quick facts about state salary range transparency laws <https://www.americanprogress.org/article/quick-facts-about-state-salary-range-transparency-laws/>`_

   Additionally, The European Parliament approved a new Pay Transparency Directive in March 2023. EU member states have three years to enact legislation based on the directive, and several - including Sweden, Belgium, Poland, and Ireland - have already taken steps. Part of the directive involves measuring and eliminating any gender-based pay discrepancies. More information is available here: `Commission welcomes the political agreement on new EU rules for pay transparency <https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7739>`_

Pay transparency policy and legal requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

47.6% of respondants - the majority - reported that their organization had no pay transparency policy. The next largest group, at 27.9%, were unsure if there was a policy or not. The final 24.5% were fairly evenly split between partial disclosure (9.5%), disclosure forbidden (8.3%), and full disclosure (6.7%).

The proportions of organizations in each category has not changed significantly over the three years we have asked this question.

We asked for the first time in 2024 if respondents were aware of the legal requirement for pay transparency in their organization's location. 44.6% were unsure, 42.9% reported that there was no legal requirement, and 12.5% said that pay transparency was legally required.

Survey feedback
===============

Following on from last year, we again included some questions about the survey itself.

.. raw:: html

   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| 
   
   **Have you participated in a WTD Salary Survey before?**

   - Yes
   - No

   **How strongly do you agree with the following statements about this survey?** [Strongly agree] [Agree] [Neutral] [Disagree] [Strongly disagree]

   - The questions are relevant
   - The survey form and website are usable
   - The length of the survey is appropriate

.. raw:: html

   </details>

Half of respondents were repeat participants, with 50.1% having taken part in a previous survey.

Overall, most respondents were positive about the survey, with "Strongly agree" and "Agree" being the top options selected for each of the feedback rating scales. 2.7% felt that the length of the survey was not appropriate, and 0.6% felt the questions were not relevant. 3% expressed doubts about the usability of the survey form and website, undoubtedly caused by known issues with the performance and layout on mobile devices.
