Introduction
============ 

Now in its fourth year, the Write the Docs Salary Survey collects information from documentarians across various regions, covering not only salaries but also work environments and perspectives on job-related issues. Our aims are to assist community members in determining appropriate salary brackets, provide a reference point for future wage negotiations, and spark discussion.

The 2022 survey accumulated data from 525 participants, including both employees and independent contractors, located in 43 countries. Although the number of responses has decreased compared to previous years (with 959 in 2021, 805 in 2020, and 649 in 2019), the information obtained remains significant, and we trust that the resulting insights will aid community members in better understanding the salary landscape.

   .. rubric:: Note on independent contractors

   Unfortunately, due to the small number of contractor respondents, no statistically relevant data can be extracted regarding income or satisfaction for this group. The salary and salary satisfaction data is therefore drawn from employee respondents only. For all other questions, the data is from both groups combined. 

Feedback

We’d love your thoughts on this survey, so that we can continue to develop and refine it. Email us at support@writethedocs.org with your ideas.

Employment parameters
=====================

In this section, we asked about the parameters of the respondent’s employment:

- the number of hours they worked, or if they were not currently working,
- the length of time they had held the same position, 
- whether they worked solo or as part of a team and how they classified their role, and
- how focused their role was on tasks related to documentation.

Basis of employment
-------------------

While the majority of respondents – historically and in 2022 – are employees, a proportion are classified as independent contractors, freelance operators or self-employed individuals. To better cater for the differences between these groups, we ran two different versions of the survey side by side, starting in 2021. 

In 2022, 93.5% of respondents (491 individuals) were employees, and 6.5% (34 individuals) were independent contractors - similar ratios to previous years.

   <details><summary>What we asked (click to expand)</summary>

.. container:: question

   How many hours per week do you work?

   - I’m not currently working
   - 1–20 hours
   - 21–30 hours
   - 31–40 hours
   - 41–50 hours
   - 51–60 hours
   - More than 60 hours

.. raw:: html

   </details>

In 2022, only 6 individual respondents (1.1%) reported that they were not currently working – down from 2021, when 2.5% (20 respondents) indicated this. Unemployed respondents were asked to complete the survey as though they were still in their previous employment situation.

The majority of respondents worked traditional "full-time" hours:

- 95.2% worked more than 30 hours per week
- 62.4% worked between 31 and 40 hours
- 2.8% worked 51 hours or more

Of the 4 individuals who entered more than 60 hours, 3 reported working 65 hours per week, and one person reported working 80 hours per week.

   <details><summary>What we asked (click to expand)</summary>

.. container:: question

   What is your job title?

.. raw:: html

   </details>

With typos removed and abbreviations expanded, 171 unique job titles emerged (1 respondent indicated that they did not have a job title). Although this number, which represents around 3.07 respondents per unique title, is fewer than in previous years - there were around 3.55 respondents per distinct title in 2021, 3.16 in 2020, and 3.13 in 2019 - the trends are similar: "Technical Writer" was the most widely-used exact title at 27.8%, followed by "Senior Technical Writer" at 17%. 

Of all titles:

- 73.5% contained the word "technical"
- 68% contained "writer" or "writing" but only 1.9% contained "editor" or "editing"
- 62.4% contained both the words "technical" and "writer" - only 1% contained "author"
- 28.9% contained "senior" but only 1% contained "junior"
- 13% contained "manager", "management", "head" or "director", while 5.7% contained "lead" or "leader" 
- 10.6% contained "docs", "document" or "documentation", and another 6% contained "content"
- 7.6% contained "developer" or "development", while 4% contained "engineer" or "engineering"
- 2.3% contained "communication" or "communications"
- 1% contained "support"

Role category
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the first time this year, respondents could select more than one role category - and 38.5% did so. Two roles were selected by 23.2% of respondents, and another 9.5% selected three roles. 

Although "Writer/Creator/Editor" was still the top category - 93.9% of respondents defining their role at least partly this way, and 57.1% identified only this category - removing the requirement for respondents to narrow their role down to just one category allowed a fuller picture of the diversity of the community to emerge, showing cross-overs with the roles of Manager (16.2%), Developer/Engineer (13.3%), Educator (12.6%), Advocate (7.8%), Support (7.2%) and Marketing (5%).

Overall, respondents selected 57 different combinations of the 8 role categories.

Team breakdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When taking into account respondents who work on a team, work on multiple teams, and those who manage teams, 83.4% of respondents have roles that are team-based. Solo workers make up 15.4%, with the 1.1% selecting "other" mostly reporting some combination of solo and team work.

   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   How long have you worked at your current organization?
   
   Note:
   Please select the length of time for your position at your current organization only – your total years of experience in documentation will be covered in the individual demographics section. If you have changed roles at the same organization, please select the length of time that you have been in your current role.

   - Less than 1 year
   - More than 1 year but less than 2 years
   - More than 2 years but less than 5 years
   - More than 5 years but less than 10 years
   - More than 10 years

   </details>

Reflecting an increasingly volatile job market, 36.8% of respondents reported being employed at their current organization for less than one year. This is a significant increase from 31.7% in 2021, 26% in 2020, and just 9% in 2019. Notably, it is the first time since the survey began that the number of individuals in new positions exceeds those who have held their current job for a medium-term or extended duration.

Of those 5.1% who had been in their current position for 10 or more years, around half reported a tenure between 10 and 20 years, while the other half reported a duration between 20 and 25 years. One respondent indicated they had held their current position for 31 years. 

Proportion of role related to documentation
-------------------------------------------

.. raw:: html
   
   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   Documentation is:

   - the whole of my official job description
   - part of my official job description
   - not officially part of my job description, but I am expected to perform documentation-related tasks
   - not officially part of my job description, and I am not expected to perform documentation-related tasks, but I do anyway

   Approximately what percentage of your day-to-day tasks are documentation-related?

   - 0-25%
   - 26-50%
   - 51-75%
   - 76-100%

.. raw:: html

   </details>

As Write the Docs is a documentation-focused community, it's not surprising that the majority of respondents (73.1% in 2022) reported that documentation makes up both their whole official job description, and most or all of their day-to-day tasks (90.3% reporting more than 51% of their daily workload). Given the cross-disciplinary nature of documentation work, it's also not surprising that a proportion of respondents also work outside of that definition, and that there are even a small number documenting "by stealth": those that are not officially designated as documentation employees or not required to perform documentation-related tasks, but do anyway.

Interestingly, of the respondents who indicated that documentation was the whole of their official job description, 31% reported spending less than three quarters of their daily work time on documentation, with 5% reporting less than half their time. 

Work location and COVID-19
==========================

In the 2019 survey, we asked respondents about their work location - whether they worked from an office, remotely, or a mixture, and whether this was their choice or if work location was stipulated by their employer. 

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to many changes to the way we live and work. Although work location was not the only area impacted, moving from an on-site office location to remote work was a change reported by nearly 80% of respondents. 

There was some uncertainty about whether to include COVID-19 questions section in the 2022 survey. It was decided that with a number of companies publicly announcing the implementation of "back to the office" policies, these questions were still relevant. 

For the purpose of this section, we consider “remote” to have the same meaning as “work from home” or “home office”.

   Those who answered "Yes" were then asked:

   Before COVID-19, what was your work location?

   - I was required to be on-site full time
   - I was on-site full time, but it was not required
   - I was partially on-site, and partially remote
   - I was fully remote, but it was by choice (i.e. an office location was available to me)
   - I was fully remote, and it was required (i.e. no office location was available to me)

   What is your current work location?

   - I am required to be on-site full time
   - I am on-site full time, but it is not required
   - I am partially on-site, and partially remote
   - I am fully remote, but it is by choice (i.e. an office location is available to me)
   - I am fully remote, and it is required (i.e. no office location is available to me)

   What changes occurred to your work location as a result of COVID-19?

   - My work location changed permanently
   - My work location changed temporarily and has now changed back
   - My work location changed temporarily and has not yet changed back

   - I am partially on-site, and partially remote
   - I am fully remote, but it is by choice (i.e. an office location is available to me)

Affected by COVID-19
--------------------

53.9% of respondents reported that their workplace had changed due to COVID-19 - down from 73.9% in 2021, and 80% in 2020. This decrease reflects the number of people who have started new jobs since the pandemic started.

As in previous years, the bulk of the changes were moving from on-site to remote or partially remote.

A sign that the situation is settling down, perhaps: 54.4% of respondents in this category reported that their work location change (or, in the case of 7.1% of respondents, multiple changes) had now become permanent, and 17.7% stated that the change had been temporary and was now changed back.

46.1% of respondents indicated that their current work location was unaffected by COVID-19. Of these, the majority worked remotely - 41.3% were required to be remote, and 36.8% were remote by choice. 13.6% were partially remote, and only 8.2% worked on-site (4.5% by requirement and 3.7% by choice).

Overall, this group was happy about their work location: 66.1% reported feeling "very positive", 26.4% "positive", 5.4% "neutral", and only 2.1% "negative" (no respondents felt "very negative").

Breaking down attitudes by work location, those who are able to choose their work location - be it on-site, remote, or a combination - are generally happier than those who have their workplace stipulated by their employer. All of the negative responses were attributed to respondents required to be on-site, required to be remote, or partial (implying that one portion of the partial arrangement was required, and not that respondent's preference).

Overall work location
---------------------

Combining the "current" work location for respondents affected by COVID-19 with the work location for those unaffected, we can put together an overall picture. 

68.9% of all resondents work remotely, either by choice (41.7%) or as required by their employer (27.2%). Another 24.8% work partially on-site and partially remote. Only 6.3% work completely on-site (3.6% are required to do so and 2.7% do so by choice).

Breaking this down by work location, the same patterns emerge. 89.1% of respondents who were working remote by choice reported feeling "very positive" (61.2%) or "positive" (27.9%), with only 0.9% feeling "negative" and no one reporting "very negative" feelings. For those working remote by requirement, while 92% were happy with the arrangement (67.1% "very positive" and 25.2% "positive"), 2.8% reported "negative" feelings.     

For those working partially remote and partially on-site, opinions were more evenly dispersed - 46.2% felt "positive", 25.4% declared they were "neutral", and 6.9% harbored "negative" feelings (5.4% "negative" and 1.5% "very negative").

The number of respondents working on-site was small (6.3%, or 33 individuals), which means that any generalizations are not representative. For the record, "neutral" feelings were the most common at 30.3%.

Salary and benefits
===================

This section is where the survey forms diverged for employees and contractors: employees were asked for their monthly or yearly salary and any additional benefits, and contractors were asked for their fee structures and rates. Both groups were asked to evaluate their levels of satisfaction with their salary and their overall work situation, for any reasons for dissatisfaction with either, and also what they liked about their work.  

Unfortunately, due to the small number of contractor respondents (only 34), no statistically relevant data can be extracted regarding income or satisfaction for this group. The data in this section is therefore drawn from employee respondents only.   

Currencies
----------

Respondents reported being paid in 27 different currencies. To make comparisons possible, all currencies were converted to USD using mid-market exchange rates, averaged for the whole of 2022.

Salary
------

   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   What currency are you paid in?

   Would you prefer to enter your salary as a yearly or monthly amount?
   
   What is your salary (including tax)?

.. raw:: html

   </details>

Employees were given the option of entering their salary as a monthly or as a yearly figure, to cater for different countries where one or the other is the norm. Monthly salaries were multiplied by 12 in order to compare them to annual salaries. 

In 2022, 79% of employee respondents entered an annual salary figure, and 21% entered a monthly figure. 

As 95.2% of respondents reported working full-time hours (more than 30 per week), the salaries for those working part-time hours (less than 30 per week) have been omitted from the figures in this section. 

Median salary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The median employee salary across all regions was USD $79,506 (meaning half of all respondent earned more, and half earned less). This is lower than the overall median in 2021 and 2020 (USD $80,870 and USD $80,000, respectively), but higher than the overall median in 2019 (USD $74,500).

Median salary by respondent region
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given the range of socio-economic differences in the countries in the survey results, median salary figures broken down by country of residence of employee is more useful than overall median salary.

In order to protect the privacy of respondents, median salaries are not shown for any country or region with less than 10 respondents. Countries excluded by this condition are:

- Armenia
- Belarus
- Belgium
- Brazil
- Croatia
- Czech Republic
- Estonia
- Finland
- France
- Greece
- Hungary

Median salary by gender identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to there being fewer than 10 respondents, non-binary and "other" gender identities could not be included in this section, and breakdowns by gender identity for regions other than North America and Europe are also not possible. 

Illustrating the much-discussed gender pay gap in effect, the median salary for men was 14.4% higher than the median for women in North America, and 26.7% higher in Europe.

Median salary by years experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a general rule, as experience increases, median salary rises - ranging from $54,613 for those with 1-2 years of experience, peaking at $130,197 for those with 25-30 years of experience, and dropping off slightly to $115,500 for those with more than 30 years of experience. 

However, in this year's results there is a new spike in salaries for respondents with less than 1 year of experience - this group's median is USD $3,500 higher than the slightly more experienced bracket of 1-2 years.

Median salary by organization size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While there is a general trend for higher salaries at larger organizations, the uneven distribution of respondent numbers makes concrete conclusions difficult to draw.

Benefits
--------

In almost all countries apart from the US, employees are entitled to paid vacation time and paid sick leave by law, and many also mandate pension contributions and/or paid parental leave. Similarly, many countries have some form of universal health care, negating the need for employer-provided health cover. To make this clearer, we asked respondents to only check the boxes for vacation time, health insurance, pension plans and parental leave if their employee benefit was in excess of what is required by law in the country where they live.

Respondents were then asked to indicate reasons for any dissatisfaction - again, considering only their salary and benefits. The largest proportion of respondents - 42.4% - chose no reason (including 2 of the respondents who indicated they were "very unsatisfied").

Of those respondents who chose "other" and entered an additional reason, the main areas of complaint were lack of 401k matching, no raises or low raises, and lowered effective income through inflation and currency fluctuations. Several respondents noted that although their salary was competitive for the area in which they reside, it was not competitive for the wider region - information gleaned from previous years' salary survey results.

Respondents were asked to consider their overall employment situation - separate from salary and benefits - and rate their level of satisfaction. Most respondents reported being satisfied (46.8%) or very satisfied (32.6%) with their job. A smaller percentage of participants expressed feeling neutral (13.2%), unsatisfied (6.7%), or very unsatisfied (0.6%) about their employment.

Of those respondents who chose "other" and entered additional reasons, many cited issues with management ("chaos", lack of leadership, not modelling corporate values, inexperienced and out of touch managers). Another common area of concern was around work location: being forced back into working on-site, or an employer refusing to consider remote work. On the other end of the spectrum, several respondents missed working face-to-face with co-workers or had issues with their remote work setup, such as timezone mismatches. 

Positive job aspects
--------------------

Respondents in general selected far more reasons to be happy about their job than reasons to be unhappy. Only one respondent chose "none", and most respondents selected more than one reason.

- autonomy

Pay transparency
================

New in the 2022 survey, we explored a concept that’s garnering a lot of attention lately: pay transparency. We define organizations with pay transparency as those that are open about salaries and benefits for existing and prospective employees and contractors.

.. raw:: html
   
   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   Is there an official pay transparency policy at your organization?

   -	Yes - compensation is disclosed for all roles, levels, and job listings to all employees and candidates
   -	Yes - but disclosure is limited to certain roles, levels, candidacy or employment status, or location
   -	Yes - the policy forbids disclosure on compensation
   -	No - there is no policy on compensation disclosure
   -	I am not sure 

   Regardless of official policy, is there a culture of sharing salary information at your organization?

   -	Yes - all or most of my co-workers openly share salary information
   -	Partial - some of my co-workers share salary information
   -	No - salary information is not openly shared
   -	I'm not sure, or I do not participate

   Regardless of the situation at your organization, how do you personally feel about pay transparency?

   -	Strongly oppose
   -	Oppose
   -	Neutral
   -	Support
   -	Strongly support

   </details>

Pay transparency policy
-----------------------

52.4% of all respondents reported that there was no pay transparency policy at their organization, and another 23.8% were unsure. 9.5% of companies had a partial policy, limiting diclosure to certain roles, levels, status or location. 9% of organizations had an explicit policy forbidding pay disclosure. 

Just 5.3% of organizations - the smallest proportion - had a fully open pay transparency policy.

Pay transparency practise
-------------------------

Regardless of official policy - or in the absence of an official policy - it seemed plausible that employees at some organizations would have an informal culture of sharing with regards to salary information. Only 1.7% of respondents reported that this existed in their workplace. 17.9% said that this was partially true, and another 14.5% said they were unsure or did not participate. The largest percentage - 65.9% - reported that there was no informal sharing of salary data.

Based on feedback from previous surveys, we altered this question in 2022 to allow multiple industries to be selected. 33.7% of respondents chose more than one industry – 18.7% selected two, and 6.1% selected three. In total, 974 industries were chosen by the 525 respondents. 

While each of the 33 industries in the list accounted for at least 3 individual responses, the largest industry represented in 2022 (as in previous years) was software development (not industry-specific), with 24.2% of the total. Finance, telecommunications, data (a new category in 2022 that includes data science, data analytics, AI and machine learning, and blockchain), security and healthcare each accounted for more than 5%. The other 27 categories shared the remainder.

.. container:: question
   
   What is the highest level of education that you have completed?

   If your education level isn't listed, choose the option that's the closest equivalent to the level you have completed. 
   
   Note: the question asks for the highest level completed so if you are still working towards a qualification, please select the highest level you have actually finished.

   -	High school
   -	Technical or vocational qualification
   -	College or university graduate qualification (certificate, diploma, associate degree, bachelor's degree)
   -	Multiple graduate qualifications
   -	Post-graduate degree (master's degree, post-graduate diploma or certificate, doctorate)
   -	Multiple post-graduate qualifications
   -	None of the above
   -	I'd rather not say

Based on the responses gathered from previous surveys, this year additional options were added for those holding multiple qualifications. 

The majority of respondents – 94.4% – listed college or university qualifications (or equivalent) as their highest level of education. Nearly half held a single graduate qualification (49.3%), while another 37.1% held a single post-graduate qualification. 8% held multiple qualifications – 5.1% multiple post-graduate, and 2.9% multiple graduate.

Technical or vocational qualifications accounted for 2.1% of the responses, and high school for 3%. A single respondent indicated that they had no formal educational qualifications, and a single respondent chose not to provide a response.

.. container:: question

   Which of the following best describes the type of area where you reside?

   -	Rural area (low population density, ≤5000 people)
   -	Town or suburban area (medium population density, ≤50,000 people)
   -	City or urban area (high population density, >50,000 people)

   Please refer to this World Bank article on Degree of Urbanization [https://blogs.worldbank.org/sustainablecities/how-do-we-define-cities-towns-and-rural-areas] for more clarification.

   In which country are you based?
   
   - State, Province, Territory or Region
   - City or Town

In an effort to more effectively gather information on how geographical location affects income without requiring detailed location information, we added a new question about the type of area where respondents reside: rural (low population density), town or suburban area (semi-dense population density) or city (high population density). 

In the respondent demographic data for this year’s survey, 43 different countries were represented. 46.9% of respondents live in the United States – this number is around the same as last year’s survey. Canada was next with 7.4% of respondents, and India was the third best represented individual nation, with 5% of the total.

Overall, 69.7% of respondents across all countries were city dwellers, 23.4% resided in semi-dense regions, and only 6.9% classified their location as rural. Looking at individual regions, North America had a slightly higher percentage of semi-dense dwellers, while in Europe and Oceania cities were better represented.
