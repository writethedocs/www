Salary Survey: September 2020
=============================

.. note::
    The survey results are in :doc:`salary-survey/2020`

We were amazed by the response to our Salary Survey last year.
We are excited to launch our updated `2020 Salary Survey <https://2020-salary-survey.writethedocs.org/>`_.

Our goal is to help people understand the pay scales and benefits in the software industry around documentation.
This will help people get a better understanding of what an appropriate salary is,
and then negotiate for a better one.

The survey is broken up into 4 parts,
and we expect it to take between 5 and 10 minutes to complete.

The survey was open until **Monday, November 16, 2020**.
