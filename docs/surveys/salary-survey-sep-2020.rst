Salary Survey: September 2020
=============================

We were amazed by the response to our Salary Survey last year.
We are excited to launch our updated `2020 Salary Survey <https://2020-salary-survey.writethedocs.org/>`_.

Our goal is to help people understand the pay scales and benefits in the software industry around documentation.
This will help people get a better understanding of what an appropriate salary is,
and then negotiate for a better one.

The survey is broken up into 4 parts,
and we expect it to take between 5 and 10 minutes to complete.
Please go ahead and fill it out here: https://2020-salary-survey.writethedocs.org/

The salary will be open until **Monday, November 16, 2020**,
after that we will process the data and publish the anonymized results.
