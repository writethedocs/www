Salary Surveys
==============

In 2019, we launched the first Write the Docs salary survey, to gather data about pay scales and benefits in our industry. The original goal was to help our community members better understand what an appropriate salary is and provide a basis for future negotiations. 

Overwhelmed by the positive response, we expanded the survey in 2020 and 2021 to collect information about remote work, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and satisfaction about salaries, benefits and overall job situations. We've also continued to refine the questions to better cater for independent contractors, freelancers and the self-employed. 

**The Salary Survey for 2022 is now open!** New this year: questions about pay transparency, wording clarifications and refinements, and a new, more convenient way to send private or public feedback about the survey itself. `Head on over to fill it out now, <https://salary-survey.writethedocs.org/>`_ and don't forget to share the link with your friends, co-workers and anyone you know who is involved in documentation. Submissions close on Monday 19th December 2022, and results will be made available in early 2023.
