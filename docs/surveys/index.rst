Salary Survey
=============

In 2019, we launched the first Write the Docs salary survey, to gather data about pay scales and benefits in our industry. The original goal was to help our community members better understand what an appropriate salary is and provide a basis for future negotiations.

Overwhelmed by the positive response, we expanded the survey in 2020 and 2021 to collect information about remote work, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and satisfaction about salaries, benefits and overall job situations. We've also continued to refine the questions to better cater for independent contractors, freelancers and the self-employed.
