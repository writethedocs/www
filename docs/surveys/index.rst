Salary Surveys
==============

In 2019, we launched the first Write the Docs salary survey, to gather data about pay scales and benefits in our industry. The original goal was to help our community members better understand what an appropriate salary is and provide a basis for future negotiations. 

Overwhelmed by the positive response, we expanded the survey to collect information about remote work, attitudes towards pay transparency, and satisfaction about salaries, benefits and overall job situations. Based on community feedback, we've continued to refine the questions each year - especially for independent contractors, freelancers and the self-employed. 

2023 Salary Survey now open
===========================

The `2023 Salary Survey is now accepting submissions <https://salary-survey.writethedocs.org>`_. The survey will be open until the end of 2023, and results will be made available here in the first quarter of 2024. 

We encourage everyone working in areas related to documentation to complete this survey, no matter what country you live in, what level of skill or experience you possess, or what industry you operate in. The questions are for people of all employment statuses: working or unemployed, full-time or part-time, permanent or contract, employee or freelance/self-employed. With every contribution, we gain a clearer picture of salaries in our industry - so please add your voice and share with your colleagues.
