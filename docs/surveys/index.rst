Salary Surveys
==============

In 2019, we launched the first Write the Docs salary survey, to gather data about pay scales and benefits in our industry. The original goal was to help our community members better understand what an appropriate salary is and provide a basis for future negotiations. 

Overwhelmed by the positive response, we expanded the survey to collect information about remote work, attitudes towards pay transparency, and satisfaction about salaries, benefits and overall job situations. Based on community feedback, we've continued to refine the questions each year - especially for independent contractors, freelancers and the self-employed. 

2023 Salary Survey results available
------------------------------------

A huge thank you to everyone in the WTD community: with your help, the 2023 survey broke all previous records for number of respondents, both employees and contractors. Along with finer-grained location data, this has allowed us to publish more than four times as many median salary breakdowns as in previous years.
