Call for proposals
==================

G'day, fellow documentarians! It's time: We’re very
excited to announce that we are now accepting talk proposals for our first ever
Australian mini-conference, coming up on **November 24, 2017, in Melbourne, Victoria**.

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come
up on stage to share their insights and experience at their annual conferences in US and Europe.
Whether you’ve been writing documentation for decades or you’ve just started this year, we want to hear from
you! Read on to learn more about the goals of the conference and what we look
for in talk proposals.

In the meantime, mark your calendars: **The deadline for submitting proposals is
Midnight AEST on Sept 15th, 2017.** We aim to let you know if your proposal is
accepted by 30th September.

Mini-conference goals
----------------------

The purpose of Write the Docs is to bring together people who are passionate
about documentation and give them an opportunity to interact with and learn from
their peers.

One of the defining characteristics of our community is the broad range of
professional backgrounds we hail from—and our mini-conference seeks to celebrate
that. Whether your job title is technical writer, programmer, product manager,
developer evangelist, support advocate, or something else entirely, we want to
hear from you. Bring us your tips, tricks, experiences, ideas, frustrations,
hopes, or anything else that your passion for documentation inspires you to
share!

What we’re looking for
----------------------

Although the focus of Write the Docs is on documentation, particularly within
the software industry, we aim for a wide range of talks that will lead people
in new directions. We’re after talks that deliver a fresh perspective on or
demonstrate a creative approach to writing the docs.

We encourage speakers at all levels to submit talks. First-time speakers are
great. Experienced speakers are great. Hearing the perspective of a novice
documentarian can be just as valuable as a deep-dive from an industry veteran.

We love talks that deliver hard-earned knowledge based on real-world experience
and research. We also get really excited about talks that make people look at
their craft in a different light. We are always delighted with the breadth of
knowledge that our community brings together.

We tend to avoid talks about specific tools, no matter how awesome they are.
We much prefer talks about process and culture shifts,
and the tools can play a supporting role.

If you already have an idea for what you'd like to speak about, awesome! Pitch it to us!

Presentation format
-------------------

Presentations will be scheduled in 20 minute blocks. We won't be doing Q&A after
the talks, but we ask that speakers be available at the front of the stage
for a few minutes of the break after their talk to answer questions.

Speaker benefits & logistics
----------------------------

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to participate in the community.

If you are selected to speak at Write the Docs, we will waive your attendance
fee. We regret that we are not able to cover the cost of travel or lodging for
all speakers at this time.

By not covering travel costs for our speakers, we are able to keep ticket prices
low and to make the mini-conference accessible to the largest number of participants possible.

If your proposal is accepted but you are unable to attend due to travel costs, please
let us know and we will do our best to help make it happen.

You’ll hear from us with our proposal decisions by **30th September**.
