About the conference
====================

We invite you to join folks from across Australia for a one-day event to explore the art and science of
documentation.
The Write the Docs Australia mini-conference covers any topic related to documentation in the software industry.

Write the Docs brings *everyone* who writes the docs together in the
same room:
Writers,
Developers,
Developer Relations,
and Support Staff.
We all have things to learn,
and there's no better way than coming together in the same room and getting to know each other.

The main event takes place on **November 24 (Friday) from 8.30am to 5.15pm**.
We will be at the `Meat Market <http://www.meatmarket.org.au/>`_, located `on Blackwood St, in the vibrant suburb of North Melbourne, 2 tram stops outside the Melbourne CBD .

You can find out more information about the venue and its accessibility on our :doc:`/conf/au/2017/venue` page.
