Visiting Melbourne
==================

Wondering where to stay and how to get around once you get into Melbourne?

Travelling to Melbourne
-----------------------

Melbourne has many direct rail, bus, or flight connections from most cities in Australia.
International flights arrive direct to `Melbourne Airport <http://melbourneairport.com.au/>`_ from many global hubs across Asia Pacific and US regions.

**Flights**

Melbourne's two airports, `Tullamarine`_ and `Avalon`_, provide access to many full service and low cost airlines, such as Qantas, Virgin, Jetstar and Tiger Airways.
From the airport, it is an easy 30 minute taxi or shuttle bus ride (Airbus) to the Melbourne CBD.

**Trains**

Melbourne is accessible by a direct train from Sydney (XPT train) `route 621
<https://transportnsw.info/routes/details#/regional-trains/621/76621>`_ or
`route 623
<https://transportnsw.info/routes/details#/regional-trains/623/76623>`_. Bus and
coach services or train/bus transfers are available `from other cities
<https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/getting-around/interstate-travel/>`_.

**Buses**

You can get to Melbourne from Adelaide (`Firefly Express`_) or Canberra
(`Murrays`_, `Greyhound`_) using the bus or coach services.

Getting around Melbourne
------------------------

**CBD free tram zone**

Public transport is plentiful and the `free tram zone <https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/getting-around/visiting-melbourne/#p8>`_ makes it
easy to get around the CBD.

**Public transport beyond the CBD**

If you wish to travel beyond the CBD via tram, train or bus, you will need to
purchase a Myki card ($6) from train stations, the visitors information centre
at Federation Square, newsagencies and many 7/11 stores. Find your `nearest
retail outlet
<https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki/buy-a-myki/myki-retail-outlets/>`_.

The cards need to be topped up with funds before travel, using either `myki
Money or a myki Pass <https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki/top-up-a-myki/>`_.
This can be done where you purchase your card.

A `Myki Explorer <https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/myki/buy-a-myki/myki-explorer/>`_
($15) provides you with a Myki card and a full day of travel, along with transport maps
and discounts to popular destinations.

`Public transport maps. <https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/getting-around/maps/>`_

Google maps, the PTV app or the Citymapper app can all help you navigate the
public transport system.

**Taxi, Shebah**

Taxi ranks exist around the city.

`Shebah <http://shebah.com.au/>`_ is a ridesharing service by women, for women.

**Bikes**

Melbourne has two bike sharing services available: `Melbourne bike share <https://www.melbournebikeshare.com.au/>`_ and `oBike <https://www.o.bike/>`_.

You will need to provide your own bike helmet as they are compulsory: there are
retailers near bike sharing stations that will `sell you a helmet
<https://www.melbournebikeshare.com.au/how-it-works/faq.html>`_ for $5.
