Announcing Presentations
=========================

We're excited to share with you the lineup for the 2017 Australian day event. Needless to say, the selection process was intense, as we had fewer than 6 slots for talks and many more awesome proposals than we can fit into the program.

The topics this year cover a vast range of subjects, points of view, and real-world case studies. We hope that whatever your role may be, you can find something to relate to.

You'll find more info and links to the full talk abstracts down below. You can also visit the `Sessions <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/au/2017/speakers/>`_ page for the full list of presentations.
