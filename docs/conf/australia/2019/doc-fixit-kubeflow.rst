Doc fixit: Kubeflow open source docs need your help!
=====================================================

Kubeflow is an open source product that developers and data scientists use to create machine learning systems.

The Kubeflow docs are largely written by engineers. The engineers do a great job, but sometimes a tech writer’s touch adds that extra bit of shine.

During this doc fixit, you’ll work with the Kubeflow tech writer to fix doc bugs.
The bugs include spelling mistakes, grammar that’s not quite right, sentences that could flow better, and more.
While fixing bugs, you’ll learn about working in open source on GitHub. You’ll experience a static site generator (Hugo) for publishing docs.
Best of all, you’ll improve the experience of the developers and data scientists who’re reading the docs.

The doc fixit hosts:

* `Sarah Maddox <https://twitter.com/sarahmaddox>`_ (Kubeflow tech writer at Google)

* `Alec Glassford <https://twitter.com/alecglassford>`_ (Tech writer at Google)

* `Riona MacNamara <https://twitter.com/rionam>`_ (Tech writer manager at Google)

Prerequisites
-------------

About the Kubeflow docs:

* The Kubeflow doc site is at `https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/ <https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/>`_

* The doc source is on GitHub: `https://github.com/kubeflow/website/tree/master/content/docs <https://github.com/kubeflow/website/tree/master/content/docs>`_

Preparing for the Kubeflow doc fixit:

* Bring a laptop with WiFi capabilities.

* Before you get started, you need to sign up for a GitHub account [https://github.com/join] if you don't already have one. If you have time to do this before the start of the sprint, that's great. If not, you can do it during the sprint.

* Sign the Google Contributor License Agreement (CLA). If you have time to do this before the start of the sprint, that's great. If not, you can do it during the sprint. Head over to `https://cla.developers.google.com/ <https://cla.developers.google.com/>`_ to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one. If you've already done this for some other project, you shouldn't need to do it again. If you haven't signed the CLA by the time you send your first pull request (PR) during the doc fixit, the automated Googlebot will prompt you to sign the CLA.

* It’s not mandatory to do any prework, but it will help if you know some Markdown: `https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax <https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax>`_.

We’ll have a step-by-step guide on how to update the docs, specifically for the doc fixit. If you’d like to get a head start, take a look at the guide to updating the `Kubeflow docs <https://github.com/kubeflow/website/blob/master/README.md>`_.
