Concept
=======

Write the Docs (http://www.writethedocs.org/) is a
**two day conference** focusing on documentation systems, tech writing
theory, and information delivery.

Writing and maintaining documentation involves a multidisciplinary
community of technical writers, designers, librarians, typesetters, developers,
support teams, marketers and many others. This group of people can be
collectively referred to as “documentarians”.

**Write the Docs** creates a time and a place for this community to
share information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve the art
and science of documentation.

For too long, people who care about documentation have felt alone in the
world, not able to connect with their community. Write the Docs is a
magical experience for many of our attendees, allowing them to feel like
they have found their place. We believe this is the most
important thing that our event can do, and we aim to provide that
experience again this year, and make it better than ever.

Demographics
============

We hold multiple conferences yearly:

* One in the United States in the spring
* One in Europe in the fall
* One in Australia in the winter (late spring in Australia!)

Our audience is made up of:

- Technical Writers (50%)
- Developers (15%)
- Support Staff (15%)
- Managers (10%)
- Community Contributors, Enthusiasts & Other Folks (10%)

Over 75% of our attendees represent their company at the event.
Almost all attendees are from tech companies,
such as Google or Microsoft.

Why Sponsor
===========

By supporting a Write the Docs event, your company will gain not only visibility
and credibility with front-line documentarians, but also valuable
insights that will help you get the most out of your own documentation efforts.
If you're hiring for docs positions, Write the Docs is also an excellent
opportunity to meet top-notch talent.

Our conferences are run by teams of volunteers, and we work hard to keep ticket
prices affordable for a broad range of attendees. Your sponsorship makes it
possible for all sorts of documentarians to attend our events, whether they're a
freelancer, a student or out of work. Becoming a sponsor demonstrates your
commitment to and support of good documentation, and the people who build it.

How do I get the most out of my sponsorship?
--------------------------------------------

Come prepared to engage with our community, and to learn just as much as you teach. Engage with our event as attendees as well as sponsors. Send technical staff who can chat with people on the interesting things your company is doing, and get value from the vast amount of insight in the room. We do have some decision makers in the room, but soft sells will work better than hard sales in the environment we strive for.

Who is my primary contact?
--------------------------

Eric Holscher will be your primary contact, but our team is available at sponsorship@writethedocs.org. If you have a time sensitive inquiry, please email the entire team to ensure a timely response.

What are the dates that sponsors need to know about in advance?
------------------------------------------------------------------

* **THURSDAY**: Doors open at 8am, so we recommend arriving around this time to get the most interaction with attendees. This is the official start of the conference, when sponsors tables will need to be staffed. The conference will run until around 5pm.

* **FRIDAY**: Doors open at 8:30am. Sponsor tear down in the main hall will be 4pm on Friday. That will be the end of the conference, so feel free to book travel home that evening.

How do I use get my free tickets?
---------------------------------

You should have received a unique URL with a discount code for your free sponsorship tickets. We are happy to send it over again, just ask!

How do I use my job postings?
-----------------------------

You can post your jobs to our `job board <https://jobs.writethedocs.org/>`_.
You will be given a discount code that will let you post them for free,
please ask us for this if you don't have it!
They will be published in our :doc:`Newsletter </newsletter>` every month,
and displayed on our website as well.

What happens with my swag items?
--------------------------------

We will have a few "swag tables" that are placed around the back of the main room. This will be where sponsor and community stickers & swag will be located, so that attendees are free to pick it up. If you have a booth, you are also welcome to place swag on the booth.

How do I ship items?
--------------------

Prior to the event, if you'd like to ship swag, we will send you the mailing address **3 weeks** prior to the event. We can't receive packages before that. Anything sent to us will be available at the venue on the day of the event.
