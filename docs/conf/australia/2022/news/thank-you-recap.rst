Conference highlights and thanks to the community!
--------------------------------------------------

G'day everyone,

The Write the Docs Australia team is now emerging from the post-conference recovery period, and we wanted to send out a quick message to thank everyone for helping to make our 2022 Australia online conference such a success.
We appreciate everyone who makes the conference possible: speakers, sponsors, organizers, volunteers, and attendees alike!
We're happy to share some of the highlights with you.

Conference recap
=================

We had almost one hundred attendees and were happy to see folks come back after the Write The Ddocs Australia team took a year out in 2021. We had the usual mix of main stage and lightning talks, and a social event.
We thought everything went pretty smoothly this year; we’re getting pretty good at virtual events!

Overall, we were excited with how our awesome community came together in our virtual venue.
Lots of knowledge was shared, and we had a great time.

Videos
======

Videos of the talks and lightning talks are now available on `our YouTube playlist <https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy70RNJ7dYrJB-2yuGw-bTppEDmQr5T56>`__. We also included the Q&A recordings for the main talks.

Thanks again to `Bart at Work <https://www.bartatwork.com/atwork/>`__ for doing such a great job with these. You can also subscribe to our `YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/writethedocs>`__ so you don't miss any future content!

Sketchnotes
============

We’re excited to share the `full resolution sketchnotes`_ from the conference on Flickr. You are welcome to use them for non-commercial purposes, like including in your write up from the conference :)

Thanks to `Linette Voller`_ for doing them again this year!

The campaign will run in 3-day batches until December 31st 2022. Shipping is available from the USA or Europe.

Write the Docs Slack
--------------------

Our Slack network has really grown more this last year. Our #general Slack channel has been extra busy in the days and weeks leading up to the conference, and we hope that y’all continue the conversations throughout the year. If you haven’t joined, now is the time! 
Check out the `Write the Docs Slack`_.

Write the Docs Newsletter
-------------------------

Our `monthly newsletter`_ is the other place to keep track of everything that is happening with the community. 
Subscribe to make sure you hear about all the conferences, meetups, job postings, and summaries of relevant conversations in our Slack.

.. _monthly newsletter: http://writethedocs.org/newsletter/

Local Meetups
-------------

We hope you continue to `build your local or online communities`_ and keep in touch with other documentarians. 
We have a number of meetups in cities across the country, and if you don’t see your city listed consider `starting`_ a meetup!

New this year are our `Quorum Meetups`_ which are virtual and targeting large geographic areas. There’s already one covering most everyone in the US or in a similar timezone.

Code of Conduct transparency report
===================================

As with any Write the Docs event, this conference was covered by our `community Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__.
We aim to be as transparent with CoC incidents and enforcement as we can.

To ensure that our CoC was visible and accessible, we took a number of specific steps:

- Every participant agreed to the Code of Conduct in advance during registration.
- The CoC, or a summary, was included on the conference website and Hopin Reception
- The CoC was repeatedly mentioned in our conference introduction and announcements.
- We specifically stressed that the CoC applies to all conference spaces including the social event.
- We encouraged all attendees to report any incident, even if they were not sure whether it was a violation.

None of our organizers were approached about any CoC concerns at this event.
We know that this is, in part, a reflection of the thoughtful and inclusive community that we're so lucky to have.

That being said, we're also very conscious of the fact that just because nothing was reported doesn't mean nothing happened.
If there was any personal conduct or other aspect of the conference experience that did not meet the expectations of behaviour set out in the CoC, please email us at `conduct@writethedocs.org <mailto:conduct@writethedocs.org>`_.

Ready for more?
===============

We are already talking 2023 folks! Our `Portland conference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2023/>`__ has announced its dates for 7-9 May and CFPs are now open.
You can `submit a talk for the Portland conference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2023/cfp/>`__ until **midnight Pacific time 13 February 2023**.
This conference will take place in-person in Portland.

If you cannot make the Portland conference, we have also announced dates for the online `Atlantic conference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/atlantic/2023/>`__.

Our Slack network has expanded yet again this year.
Our #general Slack channel has been extra busy in the days and weeks leading up to the conference, and we hope that you will continue the conversations throughout the year.
If you haven't joined, now's the time!
Check out the `Write the Docs Slack <http://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`__.

We’re also looking for more sponsors to make our other events just as magical as this year’s Australia event.
You can see all our `sponsorship options <https://www.writethedocs.org/sponsorship/>`__ on our website.

Thanks again
============

We're so grateful to our sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and attendees for making this conference possible.
Whether you were able to come out this time or not, we hope to see you again next year – or even sooner at one of our other events!
