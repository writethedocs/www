Announcing Write the Docs Australia {{year}}
==============================================

G'day and welcome to the official launch of `Write the Docs Australia {{year}} <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/>`_,
our fifth virtual conference.

We're excited to announce the dates for our next conference:
**Write the Docs Australia 2022 will be on December 8-9, 2022**

We will be running a **virtual event** again this year, same as our Portland and Prague conferences.
We make this very difficult decision with the understanding that it will disappoint some of you.
We also make this decision with the knowledge that it will relieve some of you from stress or anxiety.

**After talking with our vendors and staff, we determined we couldn't produce the quality of event that our attendees expect if we run a hybrid event.**

If you want to read more about the detailed reasons for keeping our events virtual this year, check out the `Portland conference is going back to virtual <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2022/news/conference-going-virtual/>`_ blog post.

It's been another rough year for a lot of us, especially for our community members in the Australia and Pacific regions, but we hope that by the time the conference happens the situation will be calmer and that we'll see many of you join us from wherever you are in the world.

The conference will take place during day time in AEDT_.
