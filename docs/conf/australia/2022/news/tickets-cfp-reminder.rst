Ticket Sales, Grant Program, and Call for Proposals Reminder
=============================================================

Greetings, documentarians! Just a quick reminder that tickets are `on sale now <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/tickets/>`_, and to remind you that our `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/cfp/>`_ is still open.

Following the success of our previous virtual conferences, we look forward to more opportunities to bring the community together virtually. We excited to share the wonderful energy of our community wherever you are in the world.

If there is something you’d really like to see a talk about this year, submit a proposal for it or refer someone else who would be good!

Get your ticket for the conference
-----------------------------------

**The Australia conference will be held online on {{ date.short }}.** The `full event website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/>`_ is live, with some preliminary details, and we'll be filling in more as it gets closer.

Tickets are already on sale, so go ahead and `register for your ticket now <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/tickets/>`_!

Similar to our previous years' virtual conference, we're going to keep as much as possible of the spirit of the event alive:

* Excellent single track of pre-recorded presentations with live moderated Q&A
* Unconference sessions
* A virtual hallway track
* A social event of some kind, bring your own beverage and snacks :)

We really want to make sure that folks can get value from being at the event at the same time, and we think it will be another great year of helping our community connect.

Grant program
-------------

We updated our grant program application to take into account the virtual format of the event.
We're excited to be able to offer free tickets to a larger number of people, since there are now minimal other costs to attend the event.

You can apply by **{{ grants.ends }}** on `our website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/opportunity-grants/>`_.

Submit your talk by {{ cfp.ends }}
----------------------------------------------

There are still a couple of weeks left to submit your proposal! Check out the `Call for Proposals page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/cfp/>`_ for more details about what we are looking for.

And if you already have an idea but you’re having a hard time getting your proposal to come together, you can always ask for feedback on the `Write the Docs Slack <https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`_. The community is there to help!

We’ll then be reviewing all the talk proposals, and will be contacting everyone who submitted a proposal by **{{ cfp.notification }}**.

Support our community by sponsoring
-----------------------------------

Every year we are fortunate to have the support of like-minded organizations and communities, who believe in the collaborative and welcoming community spirit and help us make our events great.

We have published our `virtual sponsorship prospectus`_ for the conference,
and are open for new sponsorship inquiries.
