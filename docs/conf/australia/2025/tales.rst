Tales from the Trenches
=======================

**Where real stories meet tech docs.** This year, Write the Docs Australia is excited to introduce "Tales from the Trenches"—a new initiative inviting attendees to share their unique experiences and offer fresh perspectives. 

We’re offering the usual `lightning talks`_ session on Day 1, but with "Tales from the Trenches" on Day 2, we’re setting three broad topics to help spark ideas and focus your stories. 

Why join in?
------------
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Great things happen when we share what we know. Our community is made up of technical writers, programmers, support teams, developer advocates, content strategists, and more; and we all work in such different spaces—public, private, and open source. 

Sometimes the best conversations are the ones that happen in the hallway between sessions. With "Tales from the Trenches," we’re bringing those gems onto the stage for everyone to hear and enjoy.

Who’s it for?
-------------
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
"Tales from the Trenches" is for everyone\! Whether you’re a natural on stage or this is your first time holding the mic, all are welcome. Some of us have great stories but aren’t sure what’s worth sharing, while others want to speak but don’t know where to start. 

This is a relaxed, open space for all of us to share a story or two. We’re all peers here, learning from each other as we go.

How It Works
------------
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
- **Talks on Day 2**: "Tales from the Trenches" will close out Day 2 with 5-7 minute lightning-style talks—no slides, just you and your story.  
- **Pick a topic**: Choose from one of our three topics to get your ideas flowing.  
- **Sign up**: Add your name to the sheet when you register to claim your spot under a topic. If spots fill up fast, we’ll draw names to keep things fair.

Topics for your tales
---------------------

- **AI in documentation** – What problem did AI ***not*** solve for you? How has AI changed how you work? This could include experiences with AI tools, automation, challenges, and how tech writers are navigating the world of AI.  
- **Tech writing fails & documentation horror stories** – We’ve all been there. Whether it’s an embarrassing moment, a big mistake, or just a funny story, we’ve all had fails. Tell us what happened and what you learned!  
- **Soft skills in technical writing** – What’s a soft skill that’s made a difference in your work? Share stories about resilience, time management, dealing with imposter syndrome, mentoring others, or balancing feedback.

Your five minutes of fame!
--------------------------

Whether it’s a documentation horror story, a tech-writing hack, or a valuable lesson learned, your story matters. Step up, share a tale, and make your mark at the conference\! Plus, by contributing, you’ll be adding to a rich, diverse experience that everyone can learn from.
