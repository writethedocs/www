Cancelling WTD Australia 2025 conference
=========================================

G'day folks. We're writing to let you know that we have decided to cancel our WTD Australia conference for 2025.

Cancelling the conference wasn't our first choice, and we engaged the community seeking ideas on whether we should pivot to a smaller or a more focussed event, but taking a break emerged as the clear path forward.
This has not been an easy decision, and we recognise that some people may be disappointed, but with the stress of the current job market and uncertainties emerging from a rapidly changing work environment, this is a good time to take a break.


Some conference housekeeping
-----------------------------

* If you already registered a ticket for the conference, we will refund these promptly and in full, without any cancellation fees.
* For those who submitted a talk proposal, we thank you greatly and invite you to resubmit your talks for our conferences (Portland, Berlin, Australia) next year.
* We will be closing the CFP process before the weekend, cancel future ticket sales, and publish this announcement on the conference website, along with the relevant Write the Docs Slack channels and other social media.

What about the meetups and what about next year?
-------------------------------------------------

We have a meetup currently planned for 24th Sept in Melbourne, but given the low numbers of RSVPs, this will not go ahead as planned. We will also pause planning any other meetup events until early next year.

The Australia Write the Docs team is relatively small. We would love to see some more participation from the wider community across our time zones, in terms of ideas, involvement in local events, ways to reboot the conference in alignment with expectations, and fresh enthusiasm! ```
When we first started the Write the Docs Australia community in 2016, we built, and grew this around active participation from folks, but over the recent years, particularly post-COVID, we have seen a drop-off in numbers both at our local events, and the annual conference. This has made planning for events and the conference a super-focussed task, but given the enthusiasm and current engagement from the community, we have no choice but to take a break this year.


Other conferences and activities
--------------------------------
This announcement **does not** affect any of our other conferences and activities.
Our Berlin 2025 conference will still take place as planned. Tickets are currently on sale, and we have announced the schedule on the website.

Stay safe and we hope to see you next year!
