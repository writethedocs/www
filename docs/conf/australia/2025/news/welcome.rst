Announcing Write the Docs Australia {{year}}
==============================================

G'day and welcome to the official launch of `Write the Docs Australia {{year}} <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/>`_,
our eighth conference.

We're excited to announce the dates for our next conference:
**Write the Docs Australia 2025 will be on November 20-21, 2025** and will take place virtually/online.

The conference will take place during day time in AEDT_.

.. _AEDT: https://time.is/AEDT

We are running a **virtual event** this year, a bit of a change from our onsite event last year in 2024.
We make this very difficult decision with the understanding that it will disappoint some of you.
We also make this decision with the knowledge that it will relieve some of you from stress or anxiety of onsite events.

Why are we going back to a virtual event?
------------------------------------------

A lot of this has to do with the fact that ours is a very unique event in this region, and we recognise the need to make it accessible to folks in our geographies to attend.
Last year, while we had a very successful onsite event, we did not get the numbers we were hoping to get, and a lot of folks from other countries in our part of the world missed out due to various reasons.

While the core event will be virtual, we are thinking of ideas on still coming together locally in Australia to hang around other documentarians for a social event. We will release more details on this shortly.

Call for Proposals
------------------

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

We plan to launch our CFP early to mid June and have it last until sometime until late August.
Get started coming up with ideas for the conference now.

Tickets
-------

Tickets will officially go on sale in **July {{ year }}**.
We will announce ticket prices soon, so that you can start planning your budget.
As with the previous years, we have tiered pricing to make it fair for everyone.

As always, we keep ticket prices low so that it is accessible to the widest range of people possible.
However, if you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend, we will bringing our Opportunity Grants program back again this year.
