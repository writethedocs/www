  SUBJECT: Professional Development: Documentation Community Conference

  I'd like to attend Write the Docs {{city}}, which takes place {{ date.main }}. This three-day online event explores the art and science of documentation, and covers a diverse range of topics related to documentation in the software industry.

  Write the Docs conferences bring together everyone who writes the docs – Tech Writers, Developers, Developer Relations, Customer Support – making the events an ideal networking opportunity.
  Each conference successfully combines a number of different event formats to deliver engaging, practical, and timely content.

  There is a single track of talks, a parallel unconference event, and a community writing day. The `sessions from last year </conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{year-1}}/speakers/>`_ will give you a good idea of the kinds of topics covered, many of which are relevant to my work.

  Costs:

  * Conference ticket (includes breakfast and lunch) - {{tickets.corporate.price}}

  Benefits:

  * Discovering solutions to problems I'm facing at work
  * Exposure to the latest ideas, techniques, and tools for software docs
  * Opportunity to learn from the best doc teams in the industry
  * Building professional connections with other documentarians

  Thanks in advance,
  [your name]

Resources
---------

When discussing how to pitch the conference, a few generally helpful tips emerged:

* Highlight a few specific talks that relate to ongoing projects at work. (This one's dependent on pitching after the talk line up has been announced).
* If your company is looking to hire another documentarian, the job fair and networking at the event are an excellent resource.
* Don't forget that one of the benefits to your attendance is that it raises the visibility of your company in the community. If your team wants a reputation for caring about their docs, having people at Write the Docs is a great way to do that.

In addition, it can be useful to share some info about previous conferences. You can find the websites for previous events on :doc:`/conf/index/`, and a quick list of last year's talks down below.
But perhaps more useful might be some of the info in our :doc:`press-kit/`, which includes community testimonials, photos, and more.
