Welcome Wagon Guide
===================

Hello!

We’re your Welcome Wagon, and we’re glad you’re attending Write the
Docs! We realize a virtual conference might be totally new to you (us,
too!). This guide will help you navigate it, even if you’ve been to a
Write the Docs conference before.

We are all first-timers at this year’s virtual conference. The Welcome
Wagon is here for you, to help you make the most of it. We’d love to
virtually meet you: feel free to reach out in Chat at the virtual
conference if we can help make your time at the conference easier. You can also email us at {{ shortcode }}@writethedocs.org.
