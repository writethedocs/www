Conference highlights and thanks to the community!
--------------------------------------------------

G'day everyone,

The Write the Docs Australia team is now emerging from the post-conference recovery period, and we wanted to send out a quick message to thank everyone for helping to make our 2023 Australia conference such a success.
We appreciate everyone who makes the conference possible: speakers, sponsors, organizers, volunteers, and attendees alike!
We're happy to share some of the highlights with you.

Its especially gratifying to see so many folks join us in what has been a really tough couple of years for many, and in our first in-person conference in 4 years!

Conference recap
=================

With **70 attendees** this conference was another smashing success!
We had the usual mix of talks on the main stage along with Q&A, lightning talks, unconference sessions, discussion panel and the social event.
We thought everything went pretty smoothly this year. Lots of knowledge was shared, and we had a great time.

Overall, we were excited with how our awesome community came back together at our onsite event, and also provided great feedback after the event. We hear you and will do our best to improve your experience with this conference next year.

Videos
======

Videos of the talks and lightning talks are now available on `our Write the Docs Australia YouTube playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy70RNJ7dYrJR66QtoHmTWSqm4iAlmH-m>`__. We also included the Q&A recordings for the main talks.

Thanks again to Peter and Junko Fundeis for doing such a great job with these. You can also subscribe to the broader `Write the Docs YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/writethedocs>`__ or our very own `Write the Docs Australia YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/c/WriteTheDocsAus>`__ so you don't miss any future content!

Code of Conduct transparency report
===================================

As with any Write the Docs event, this conference was covered by our `community Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__.
We aim to be as transparent with CoC incidents and enforcement as we can.

To ensure that our CoC was visible and accessible, we took a number of specific steps:

- Every participant agreed to the Code of Conduct in advance during registration.
- The CoC, or a summary, was included on the conference website and Hopin Reception
- The CoC was repeatedly mentioned in our conference introduction and announcements.
- We specifically stressed that the CoC applies to all conference spaces including the social event.
- We encouraged all attendees to report any incident, even if they were not sure whether it was a violation.

None of our organizers were approached about any CoC concerns at this event.
We know that this is, in part, a reflection of the thoughtful and inclusive community that we're so lucky to have.

That being said, we're also very conscious of the fact that just because nothing was reported doesn't mean nothing happened.
If there was any personal conduct or other aspect of the conference experience that did not meet the expectations of behaviour set out in the CoC, please email us at `conduct@writethedocs.org <mailto:conduct@writethedocs.org>`_.

Ready for more?
===============

We are already in 2024 folks! Our `Portland conference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2024/>`__ is scheduled to happen 14-16 May and the call for proposals is now open.
You can `submit a talk for the Portland conference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2024/cfp/>`__ until **midnight Pacific time 15 January 2024**.
This conference will take place in-person in Portland.

If you cannot make the Portland conference, we will also announce dates for the online Atlantic conference soon.

We will announce dates and more details for the next Australian conference in the middle of 2024.
