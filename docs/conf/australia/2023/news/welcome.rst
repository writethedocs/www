G'day and welcome to the official launch of `Write the Docs Australia {{year}} <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/>`_,

Write the Docs Australia will be an in-person conference, similar to our pre-COVID conferences. 
Speakers will be present in person and speaking from the conference stage. We will also offer a free livestream of the talks, and remote participants are encouraged to participate in our Slack. The unconference will not be streamed.

The conference will follow all local COVID regulations that apply at the time, and we will announce more specific policies before our tickets go on sale so people can make an informed decision.
