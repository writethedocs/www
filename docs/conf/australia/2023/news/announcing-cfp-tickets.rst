Announcing Call for Proposals, Ticket Sales and the Grant program
=================================================================

G'day folks, today we are announcing our `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/cfp/>`_ and `ticket sales <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/tickets/>`_.
We'll have more updates about the conference soon, but we wanted to announce our CFP so you have time to prepare your talk ideas. 

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our inspiring community of documentarians.
If there is something youâ€™d really like to see a talk on this year, submit a proposal on it, or refer someone else who would be good!

Call for Proposals
------------------

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

**For 2023, we are going back to an in-person event**.

You can read our full `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`__ on the website.

The Call for Proposals will be open until **11:59 PM {{cfp.ends}} AEST**.

Tickets
-------

Tickets are now on sale! Take a look at the prices for the online conference on our `Tickets <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/tickets/>`_ page.

As always, we keep ticket prices low so that the event is accessible to the widest range of people possible.
However, if you can't afford the tickets and still wish to attend, you can apply for an opportunity grant ticket.

Opportunity Grants
------------------

Our grant program offers tickets to people who would otherwise not be able to attend.
We're excited to be able to offer free tickets to a larger number of people this year,
since there are now minimal other costs to attend the event.

You can apply until **October 15, 2023, midnight AEDT** on `our website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/opportunity-grants/>`_.
