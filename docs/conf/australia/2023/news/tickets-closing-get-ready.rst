Get ready for Write the Docs Australia 2023
============================================

We're just over 2 weeks out from the conference, and we hope everyone is getting excited!

In this update we share a few updates as the conference approaches.

Ticket Sales closing soon
--------------------------

We will be closing ticket sales **Wednesday, 29th November**, so if you've been on the fence, now is the time to buy one!

If you were hoping to come to this years event,
we recommend that you `get your tickets soon <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2023/tickets/>`_.

Things to prepare for
---------------------

* **Read the Visiting Melbourne information**. Our `Visiting {{city}} <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/visiting/>`__ page contains all the information you need for finding food, transit, and other things to do while you're in town.
* **Review the schedule.** The `Schedule page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/schedule/>`_ has the latest and most complete information about the presentations. This is where we will also update any changes/cancellations if they occur.
* **Review the Code of Conduct.** We have a wonderful community full of diverse and amazing people. We expect everyone to behave in a respectful manner at all conference events and online channels. Our `Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`_ has the full information.

Get involved at the conference
------------------------------

-  **Attend the STE workshop.** This year, similar to our last few conferences, we will have a workshop on Day 1 after the lightning talks. You can find out more about the workshop on the `STE workshop <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2023/workshop-ste/>`__ page.
   The workshop is free for all conference attendees and is included in your ticket price, so you do not have pay anything on top of the conference registration.
-  **Plan an unconference session.** We’ll be running the `Unconference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2023/unconference/>`__
   both days. Want to chat with like-minded folks about
   a very specific thing? This is the place. We’ll have a sign-up board
   so you know what’s happening, and supplies to help you brainstorm.
-  **Plan a lightning talk.** We’ll have `Lightning Talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2023/lightning-talks/>`__
   each day after lunch. These are 5 minute presentations and a lot of
   fun. They can be about anything you want. This is your chance to
   share something you are passionate about with the audience. Slides
   are not required.
-  **Join us at the Thursday night social.** This is an event just for conference attendees, held on *Thursday evening from 5pm-7pm*, with free snacks and drinks. It will be held at Tap831 (831 Bourke St, Docklands) with good non-alcoholic beverage options, as well as alcoholic. 
-  **Participate in the panel discussion.** This session brings together a diverse group of industry experts and you, sharing perspectives on the latest trends and challenges facing documentarians today. You can submit your questions using the `Slido panel <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2023/panel/>`__.
