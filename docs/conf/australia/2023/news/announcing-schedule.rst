Announcing Full Schedule
========================

Hey folks!

The {{city}} conference is less than two months away, and we're busy making things happen behind the scenes, and remembering how in-person conferences work again.

You've already seen our list of awesome speakers, now we can also show you the schedule so you know when they will be presenting!

Full presentation schedule
--------------------------

The conference website is now updated with the :doc:`schedule </conf/australia/{{year}}/schedule/>` for the main stage presentations, so you can start planning your time (and getting excited!) for the conference. 

We're learning and adapting from our virtual events from the past few years, so we're introducing a moderated Q&A session after each speaker. You'll have a chance to ask most of our speakers questions after the talk via our wonderful set of moderators.

Now is a great time to buy your `tickets <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_ if you haven't already.

Join us for a group activity pre-conference
--------------------------------------------

We are planning an activity for conference attendees if they are in town a day earlier (Wednesday, 6 Dec). While we don't have any details right now, we will announce this in a couple of weeks. 
Either way, if you are in town a day or two earlier, keep yourselves free for a few hours to spend with other attendees.

Simplified Technical English (STE) Workshop
--------------------------------------------

This year, similar to our last few conferences, we will have a workshop on Day 1 after the lightning talks. We will release more details about this workshop, including any pre-requisites or prior reading.
The workshop is free for all conference attendees and is included in your ticket price, so you do not have pay anything on top of the conference registration.

All our events and activities
-----------------------------

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Every year we make sure to have a variety of activities that our attendees can enjoy, whether you want to learn something, meet new people, or share knowledge.

The main events that you can participate in Thursday & Friday are:

* **Lightning Talks.** We'll have `lightning talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/lightning-talks/>`__ each conference day after lunch. These are 5 minute presentations and a lot of fun. They can be about anything you want! This is your chance to share something you are passionate about with the audience. Slides are not required.
* **Unconference.** We'll be running the `Unconference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/unconference/>`_ as our formal "second track" at the conference. This is a place to schedule discussions about a specific topic, so you can find other attendees who care about the same niche topics that you love. Want to chat with like-minded folks about oxford commas or a specific docs as code tool? This is the place.
* **Social event**. On Thursday night we'll be hosting a quiet social event. This is a great chance to get to know more folks in the community and have a drink or two on us. Non-alcoholic options will be very available, as well as some snacks.

The `Schedule page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/schedule/>`_ has the latest and most complete information about all our events.
This is where we will also update any changes/cancellations if they should occur.
