Simplified Technical English: Workshop
=======================================

Workshop host: **Shumin Chen**

Simplified Technical English (STE) started in the aerospace industry, where it emerged as a solution to address language, communication, and documentation challenges. While it initially served the defence sector, STE’s inherent versatility and adaptability have made it remarkably relevant and applicable to various industries.

This workshop explores the evolution of STE from an aerospace standard to its potential in revolutionising documentation practices in the software industry. By embracing STE, participants will gain insights into how this linguistic paradigm shift can help organisations across diverse sectors enhance clarity, efficiency, and comprehension in their software-related communication.

By the end of the session, you’ll have gained confidence with:

- Using the Git workflow day-to-day

- Managing pull requests like a pro

- Handling a basic merge conflict

- Fixing mistakes
