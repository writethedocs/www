Vaccine or Negative COVID-19 Test Requirement
-------------------------------------------------

Currently, there is no requirement for COVID-19 vaccination proof or a negative COVID-19 test for attending the Write the Docs Australia 2023 conference. 
If anything changes between now and closer to the event, attendees will be made fully aware of these requirements.

Other Testing Encouraged
------------------------

We strongly encourage attendees to test themselves for COVID before and during the conference. Rapid tests are available for sale at pharmacies throughout Melbourne.

Additionally, we intend to provide free tests to attendees who need them at registration, subject to availability. 

Masks Encouraged and Provided
-----------------------------

We are not currently requiring that masks be worn at all times in the venue.
We will be providing N95 masks to attendees at our registration desk.
There will also be signage indicating that masks are recommended.

Of all our policies, this is the one most likely to change to a mask requirement if the COVID conditions require it.
However, we are currently moving forward with additional outdoor and social distancing options at the venue.

Onsite health and safety measures
---------------------------------

Please expect the following measures to be in place at the event:

* Event signage indicating required and recommended health and safety protocols
* Wider aisles and increased event traffic flow signage to allow for physical distancing
* Plentiful hand sanitation stations onsite
* Personal hand sanitizer bottles and wipes available for participants
* Antigen COVID tests available at registration, while supplies last
* Masks available at registration, while supplies last

At a minimum, we will also be following all mandated venue and state guidelines.
**This list, and all protocols, are subject to change as the fluid COVID-19 situation changes.
Changes to this policy will only add requirements, and will not remove requirements.**

Current public health guidelines
--------------------------------
According to the `current public health guidelines issued by the Victorian Government <https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/information-travellers>`__, there is no vaccination, quarantine, permit, or testing requirement to enter Victoria.
