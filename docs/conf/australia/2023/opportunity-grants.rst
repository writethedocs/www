Opportunity grants
==================

The grant program for WTD {{ name }} {{ year }} supports people who would otherwise not be able to attend the conference by covering attendance costs. Applications are open to anyone who wants to attend Write the Docs.

{% if grants and grants.url %}
To apply, fill in the form below.
{% else %}
We expect to open the grant program around the same time as ticket sales.
{% endif %}
As the conference is virtual this year, the grant offers you a single free ticket to the conference.

We would like to encourage anyone to apply, who would otherwise have difficulties attending the conference.
You are welcome to apply, even if you have received a grant before from our conferences or any others,
regardless of the reason making it difficult for you to cover the cost, and with any experience
level or background.

Depending on the number of applications, we may not be able to provide every applicant with a free ticket. We prioritize applications based on the overall impact that granting an application will have on the applicant, the Write the Docs community, and the applicant's wider community and country, compared to others.

Grant applicants, like all other participants in the Write the Documents community, are required to conform to the Code of Conduct: https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/.

{% if grants and grants.ends %}
**Grant applications are open until {{ grants.ends }}, Midnight {{ tz }}.**
