===================================

In a first for Write the Docs conferences everywhere, weâ€™re thrilled to announce a thought-provoking discussion panel: "Tech Comms Today."

- Date & Time: **Friday, 8th December 2023, 3.05pm - 3.45pm**

A live, interactive session

This 40-minute session will feature invited guests on stage with our host, Felicity Brand, discussing questions and topics submitted by you. 

We all benefit when information flows more than one-way. You can actively comment and engage during the session. Share your insights, thoughts, and reactions in real-time as our experts tackle the issues that matter most.
