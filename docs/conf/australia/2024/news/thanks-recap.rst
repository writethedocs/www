Conference highlights and thanks to the community!
--------------------------------------------------

G'day everyone,

The Write the Docs Australia team wanted to send out a quick message to thank everyone for helping to make our 2024 Australia conference such a success.
We appreciate everyone who makes the conference possible: speakers, sponsors, organizers, volunteers, and attendees alike!
We're happy to share some of the highlights with you.

Its especially gratifying to see so many folks join us in what has been a really tough couple of years for many, and in our second in-person conference in 4 years!

Conference recap
=================

With **70 attendees** this conference was another smashing success!
We had the usual mix of talks on the main stage along with Q&A, lightning talks, unconference sessions, tales from the trenches, and the social event.
We thought everything went pretty smoothly this year. Lots of knowledge was shared, and we had a great time.

Overall, we were excited with how our awesome community came back together at our onsite event, and also provided great feedback after the event. 
We hear you and will do our best to improve your experience with this conference in 2025.

Videos of the talks and lightning talks are now available on `our Write the Docs Australia YouTube playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy70RNJ7dYrLlo1cnSh-dK5VUO8zOyB_S>`__. We also included the Q&A recordings for the main talks.

Code of Conduct transparency report
===================================

As with any Write the Docs event, this conference was covered by our `community Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__.
We aim to be as transparent with CoC incidents and enforcement as we can.

To ensure that our CoC was visible and accessible, we took a number of specific steps:

- Every participant agreed to the Code of Conduct in advance during registration.
- The CoC, or a summary, was included on the conference website and Hopin Reception
- The CoC was repeatedly mentioned in our conference introduction and announcements.
- We specifically stressed that the CoC applies to all conference spaces including the social event.
- We encouraged all attendees to report any incident, even if they were not sure whether it was a violation.

We had one CoC incident reported to the organizer. We approached the person who was reported and asked them to be considerate of their actions which may have been construed as enroaching people's personal space.

If there was any personal conduct or other aspect of the conference experience that did not meet the expectations of behaviour set out in the CoC, please email us at `conduct@writethedocs.org <mailto:conduct@writethedocs.org>`_.

Ready for more?
===============

We are already in 2025 folks! Our `Portland conference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/>`__ is scheduled to happen 4-6 May.
This conference will take place in-person in Portland.

If you cannot make the Portland conference, we will also announce dates for the online Atlantic conference soon.

We will announce dates and more details for the next Australian conference in the middle of 2025.

Support our community by sponsoring
====================================

Every year we are fortunate to have the support of like-minded organizations and communities, who believe in the collaborative and welcoming community spirit and help us make our events great.
