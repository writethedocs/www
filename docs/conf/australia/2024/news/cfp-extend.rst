Call for Proposals Extended
===========================

Greetings fellow documentarians!

The conference is now just under three months away, and we hope you’re already planning for this year's onsite installment of Write the Docs Australia conference.

New deadline to submit your proposal is 6th Sept
--------------------------------------------------

We added an extra week to the deadline in case you may missed the closing date announcements, and we wanted to give you some more time to prepare your submissions.
Make sure to get your talk in before the new deadline; we already have a lot of great proposals come in.

Check out the `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2024/cfp/>`_ page for tips and examples to help inspire you.
And if you’ve got an idea but aren't sure what to do with it, feel free to ask for feedback on `Slack <http://slack.writethedocs.org/>`_. Your fellow documentarians will be happy to help!

We will send out the decision emails to all who submitted by **mid-September**, and the final talks will be published by **end of September** or **early October**.

This is still in line with our earlier expectations around announcement dates.

We'll have more to share soon
-------------------------------

We are working through all the other aspects of the event. Expect to hear more about the welcome reception, social event, and more in the next few weeks.
This will be our seventh Australian conference and we can't wait!
