Call for Proposals, Ticket Sales, and Grant Program Reminder
=============================================================

Greetings, documentarians! Just a quick reminder that our `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/cfp/>`_ is still open, 
tickets are `on sale now <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/tickets/>`_, and you can still apply for our Grants program on `our website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/opportunity-grants/>`_.

Submit your talk by {{ cfp.ends }}
------------------------------------

There are only a few weeks left to submit your proposal! Check out the `Call for Proposals page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/cfp/>`_ for more details about what we are looking for.

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our inspiring community of documentarians.
If there is something you’d really like to see a talk about this year, submit a proposal for it or refer someone else who would be good!

And if you already have an idea but you’re having a hard time getting your proposal to come together, you can always ask for feedback on the `Write the Docs Slack <https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`_. The community is there to help!

The Call for Proposals are open until **11:59 PM {{cfp.ends}} AEST**.

We’ll then be reviewing all the talk proposals, and will be contacting everyone who submitted a proposal by **{{ cfp.notification }}**.

Get your tickets for the conference
------------------------------------

**The Australia conference will be held in Melbourne, on {{ date.short }}.** The `full event website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/>`_ is live, with some preliminary details, and we'll be filling in more as it gets closer.

Tickets are already on sale, so go ahead and `register for your ticket now <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/tickets/>`_!

Write the Docs Australia 2024 is an in-person conference. Each ticket includes:

* Entry to all conference events and activities
* Food and drinks on event days (Thursday-Friday)
* Social Event with light nibbles and drinks
* Wifi throughout the event
* Excellent single track of pre-recorded presentations with live moderated Q&A
* Unconference sessions

We really want to make sure that folks can get value from being at the event in person, and we think it will be another great year of helping our community connect.

Grant program
--------------

Our grant program offers tickets to people who would otherwise not be able to attend.
We're excited to be able to support a few people this year. However, we may prioritise applications from people who are part of a marginalized
or underrepresented group in tech.

You can apply until **October 1, 2024, midnight AEST** on `our website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/opportunity-grants/>`_.

Support our community by sponsoring
-----------------------------------

Every year we are fortunate to have the support of like-minded organizations and communities, who believe in the collaborative and welcoming community spirit and help us make our events great.

We have similar sponsorship levels again this year as last year.
In addition to the regular sponsorship levels, we have additional ways to sponsor our events.
See our `sponsorship prospectus <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2024/sponsors/prospectus/>`_ for all the options.

We're always open to customisations on our sponsorships, so feel free to reach out with ideas or questions at australia@writethedocs.org.

Thanks so much to the following companies for supporting the Australia conference this year:
