Announcing conference speakers, talks and the full schedule
============================================================

G'day, documentarians! Today we're excited to announce that we've finalised our speakers for the next Australia conference.

Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to send us a proposal – we literally wouldn't have an event without you!

Our Australian conference is happening in just over 2 months, and we're excited to see everyone again in {{city}}.

Full speaker line-up
--------------------

Each year we bring a wide range of voices to the Write the Docs. Because the role of "documentarian" looks so different to each of us, we aim for a line-up that spans a good mix of practical, philosophical, and technical topics – with the odd whimsical one thrown in for good measure.

We're really excited about the `presentations <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/speakers/>`_ we've got this year:

We hope there's something there for everyone to enjoy, and also something that will broaden your horizons a bit.

This year, we also have a couple of featured speakers, folks who we have invited to speak about their vast experiences with technical content, and also how they are seeing the whole user experience from the outside. 
We are super excited to have them present at our conference, and we think you will appreciate hearing from them too!

Full presentation schedule
---------------------------

The conference website is now updated with the :doc:`schedule </conf/australia/{{year}}/schedule/>` for the main stage presentations, so you can start planning your time (and getting excited!) for the conference. 

We're learning and adapting from our events from the past few years, so we're introducing a moderated Q&A session with the speaker, after each talk. You'll have a chance to ask most of our speakers questions after the talk via our wonderful set of moderators.

Join us for a group activity pre-conference
--------------------------------------------

We are planning an activity for conference attendees if they are in town a day earlier (Wednesday, 27 Nov). While we don't have any details right now, we will announce this in a couple of weeks. 
Either way, if you are in town a day or two earlier, keep yourselves free for a few hours to spend with other attendees.

Brick Docs Workshop
--------------------

This year, similar to our last few conferences, we will have a workshop on Day 1 after the lightning talks. We will release more details about this workshop, including any pre-requisites or prior reading.
The workshop is free for all conference attendees and is included in your ticket price, so you do not have pay anything on top of the conference registration.

All our events and activities
-----------------------------

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Every year we make sure to have a variety of activities that our attendees can enjoy, whether you want to learn something, meet new people, or share knowledge.

The main events that you can participate in Thursday & Friday are:

* **Lightning Talks.** We'll have `lightning talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/lightning-talks/>`__ each conference day after lunch. These are 5 minute presentations and a lot of fun. They can be about anything you want! This is your chance to share something you are passionate about with the audience. Slides are not required.
* **Unconference.** We'll be running the `Unconference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/unconference/>`_ as our formal "second track" at the conference. This is a place to schedule discussions about a specific topic, so you can find other attendees who care about the same niche topics that you love. Want to chat with like-minded folks about oxford commas or a specific docs as code tool? This is the place.
* **Social event**. On Thursday night, we'll be hosting a quiet social event. This is a great chance to get to know more folks in the community and have a drink or two on us. Non-alcoholic options will be very available, as well as some snacks.

The `Schedule page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/schedule/>`_ has the latest and most complete information about all our events.
This is where we will also update any changes/cancellations if they should occur.

Opportunity Grants close on Oct 1
-----------------------------------

Applications for our Opportunity Grant program **close on October 1st midnight AEDT**.
This program is open to anyone who would otherwise have difficulties attending the conference, and we'd love to have more folks applying.

* `Apply for a grant <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/opportunity-grants/>`_ before the deadline.
