# Attendee Guide

The Attendee Guide provides conference information and gives strategies and tips for new (and experienced) attendees to get plugged in and connect with others! We've gathered info here that will help you navigate the conference like a pro and make you feel more at home.

## Where can I ask a question?

The Welcome Wagon Team is available to make your conference experience better! Stop by the Welcome Wagon table or feel free to ask questions in the [#welcomewagon Slack channel](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/). Whether you have a question about the schedule, where to eat, or how to connect with other attendees, they are your go-to for conference questions. If they don't know the answer, they'll find someone who does!

**Location and Availability:**

- Welcome Wagon table is located directly next to the Registration table
- Team will be available during all conference hours

## Welcome Wagon Tours

Join us for an introduction to Write the Docs. We'll go on a short tour of the venue and review information about the conference. While tours are designed to give first-time attendees all the information they need to feel comfortable at the conference, returning attendees often find them helpful as well. This gives everyone a chance to meet someone new. Bring any questions you may have!

- Thursday 1:30 PM
- Friday 1:30 PM

## Conference Layout

Review our [Venue](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2024/venue/) page for details on the accessibility and layout of conference spaces.

## Eating

- Snacks, coffee, tea, and water are provided on conference days in the Foyer close to Price Hall.

  - Ingredients will be listed
  - Please email swapnil@writethedocs.org for other dietary requirements

## Dress Code

- We don't technically have one! Melbourne is an extremely casual-dress city and so is the Write the Docs conference. You'll be meeting business colleagues at this conference, though, so neat and comfortable are good dress guidelines.
- Bring layers! Weather is on average high 22-23°C, low of 10-12°C, but Melbourne often sees four seasons in a day, so it is advisable to carry layers.

## Driving and Parking

If you drive to the conference, note that the venue does not have parking on-site. You are able to park in the nearby streets (hourly) or commercial car parks. The venue is centrally located, and minutes within public transport, including trains and trams, so public transport is definitely recommended.

## Hotels and Transportation

- The conference is located in Melbourne Central Business District (CBD). There are many hotel options within a 5-10 minute drive, some of these are walking distance from the venue. View our [Visiting Melbourne](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2024/visiting/#where-to-stay) page for recommended hotels.
- Melbourne is an accessible city and there are many transportation options available including buses, trams, rideshare, and taxis. View our [Visiting Melbourne](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2024/visiting/#getting-around) for information.

## Accessibility

We are committed to hosting a conference that is accessible to everyone. Visit our [Accessibility section](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2024/venue/#accessibility) on the Venue page for more information.

## Tips to Have a Great Conference

- Before the conference, join the Write the Docs [Slack](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/), and follow Write the Docs on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/18284823/admin/feed/posts/) and [X, formerly known as Twitter](https://twitter.com/writethedocs).
- Attend a Welcome Wagon tour!
- Talk with people - attendees, volunteers, staff, and speakers. Don't forget to use Eric Holscher's [Pac-Man Rule](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/) to leave room for others to join! The most important part of this conference (and any conference) is the people you meet. Set a goal for yourself to meet a few new people.
- Review the speaker schedule and choose which talks you want to attend the most. Spread out your time between talks, unconference sessions, networking, and breaks.
- Starting Thursday morning, check the Unconference schedule to discover if there are any sessions you are interested in attending. New sessions are added all the time, so check back periodically.
- Give yourself and your brain a break! Conferences are exhilarating, but can also be exhausting. Grab a quiet spot in the Foyer/Price Hall or take a quick walk.
- Eat! There will be snacks available but there are many restaurants close by.
