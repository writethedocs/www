Our venue: Melbourne City Conference Centre
============================================

Our Australian conference will be held at `Melbourne City Conference Centre`_.
The fascination with MCCC lies in its unique range of venues, dating as far back as 140 years. Their venues include a Heritage-listed Chapel, modern 700-seater Auditorium and a cosy Chapel Hall & Price Hall.

Melbourne City Conference Centre is a leading multi-venue meeting and conference centre in the heart of Melbourne's Central Business District (CBD). 
We will have access to the following spaces during the conference:

* The Auditorium where we will be hosting our conference talks.
* The Price Hall which will host the unconference sessions, and where our snacks and drinks catering will happen.

The venue is centrally located and well serviced by Melbourne's public transport system, including buses, trams, and a train station right next to the venue.
