Introduction
============

Welcome to our 2024 **Conference Sponsorship Prospectus**.

We're excited to work with the organizations in our community to build the best possible event in {{ year }}.
In particular, we would love your feedback on sponsorship levels and benefits.
We expanded the offerings and introduced a lot of new things,
but please let us know if there are other points of interaction with our community that would be valuable for you.

Concept
=======

Write the Docs Australia (http://www.writethedocs.org/) is a **two day conference** dedicated to connecting content 
professionals from various disciplines. Our community includes technical writers, programmers, support teams, developer 
advocates, content strategists and more. 
We collectively refer to ourselves as “`documentarians <https://www.writethedocs.org/documentarians/>`_”. 

Each year, we 
encourage community members to share their insights and experiences. Between the talks on stage, discussions in the unconference
sessions, collaboration during the writing day, and hallway conversations — 100% of our conference content comes from our 
community.

**Write the Docs Australia** is an opportunity to explore and celebrate the craft of documentation in an inclusive 
environment, with a particular emphasis on underrepresented voices in the tech community.

{% if not flagrunofshow %}

Sponsorship events
------------------

Sponsor booths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sponsor booths are only available for our larger sponsors.
You will be given a booth that is in the *Expo area* of the online platform.
Most of the attendee focus will come during breaks between talks and at the beginning and end of the day.

**Logistics**: You can record a video to play at your booth when attendees enter the booth, but we generally recommend having someone with the Expo hall tab open to answer any questions that attendees might have. We also recommend that you answer general questions in the main booth and then break off into private calls or chat to talk in more depth to specific people.

How do I get the most out of my sponsorship?
--------------------------------------------

Come prepared to engage with our community, and to learn just as much as you teach. Engage with our event as attendees as well as sponsors. Send technical staff who can chat with people on the interesting things your company is doing, and get value from the vast amount of insight in the room. We do have some decision makers in the room, but soft sells will work better than hard sales in the environment we strive for.

Quick tips
----------

* **Arrive early**: The conference venue opens at 8am, so we recommend arriving around this time to get the most interaction with attendees.
* **Bring swag (especially stickers)**: We recommend bringing a variety of swag to give away. Stickers are by far the most popular item for our attendees.
* **Engage with folks as both a sponsor and attendee**: This is a great opportunity to meet folks in the community, so we recommend engaging with folks in an official capacity, but also as a regular attendee.
* **Use QR codes**: QR codes are a great way to get people a website quickly. We recommend using a service like https://www.qr-code-generator.com/ to create these.

Who is my primary contact?
--------------------------

Swapnil Ogale will be your primary contact, but our team is available at australia@writethedocs.org. If you have a time sensitive inquiry, please email the entire team to ensure a timely response.

During the conference itself, we will also have a *help desk* available on the Hopin platform.
You can find staff members there to ask any additional questions you might have.


How do I use my sponsorship tickets?
------------------------------------

You should have received a unique URL with a discount code for your sponsorship tickets. We are happy to send it over again, just ask!

How do I use my job postings?
-----------------------------

You can post your jobs to our `job board <https://jobs.writethedocs.org/>`_.
You will be given a discount code that will let you post them for free,
please ask us for this if you don't have it!
They will be published in our :doc:`Newsletter </newsletter>` every month,
and displayed on our website as well.
