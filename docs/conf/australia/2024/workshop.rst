Brick Docs Workshop – Build better technical writing skills with LEGO®
======================================================================

Workshop hosts: **Yvonne Perkins and Alexandra Perkins**

Do you work with engineers who find it challenging to write clear, concise, and user-focused technical documentation? Does writing feel like a 
stumbling block for your team? The `Brick Docs Workshop`_ is designed to address these challenges in a way that’s fun and engaging, using LEGO® bricks as a hands-on tool for learning!

In this one-hour session, we’ll guide participants through practical exercises that show how effective writing can be both achievable and enjoyable.
Brick Docs is a judgment-free learning space where technical writers and engineers can strengthen their skills together, making technical writing accessible and fun for everyone involved.

What to expect
--------------

- Build with LEGO® bricks while learning the essentials of clear communication.  
- Learn how to identify and fix common documentation issues.  
- Receive instructions and a list of LEGO® bricks needed to run this activity with your own team.

This workshop sharpens critical writing and editing skills, with a special focus on writing documentation that is easy for the user to understand. 

This is a safe space: no pressure, no judgments – just a creative and supportive atmosphere.

Schedule
--------

- **Time:** Day 1, Thursday 28 November 2024, 2.10pm.
- **Duration:** 2-hour session with a coffee break in the middle.

  - **Workshop time:** The Brick Docs workshop itself takes one hour, designed to fit within the typical time constraints of the average office. We want to make it practical for you to replicate when you get back to work.  
  - **Follow-up discussion:** After the break, we’ll host an unconference-style chat where participants can share ideas inspired by the workshop and discuss potential applications in their own environments.

- **Materials provided:** All LEGO® bricks and instructions are supplied but you don't get to keep them. All bricks must be returned to the facilitators at the end of the session. 
- **Laptop required?** No – just bring your creativity!   

Cost (none)
-----------

The workshop fee is included in your conference admission. There is no extra charge for the workshop.

Who's welcome
-------------

All conference participants are welcome.

- **Technical writers** – looking to improve the documentation quality their engineering colleagues produce.  
- **Engineers & non-writers** – responsible for creating technical content but who may lack confidence in their writing abilities.

Background
----------

This workshop builds on a successful presentation held at the Write the Docs Melbourne Meetup in May 2024, where interactive sessions like this one have proven highly effective for technical writers working alongside engineering teams in DevOps environments.

Get ready to build better docs!
