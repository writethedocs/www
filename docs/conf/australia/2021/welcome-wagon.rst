Welcome Wagon Guide
===================

Hello!

We’re your Welcome Wagon, and we’re glad you’re attending Write the
Docs! We realize a virtual conference might be totally new to you (us,
too!). This guide will help you navigate it, even if you’ve been to a
Write the Docs conference before.

We are all first-timers at this year’s virtual conference. The Welcome
Wagon is here for you, to help you make the most of it. We’d love to
virtually meet you: feel free to reach out in Chat at the virtual
conference if we can help make your time at the conference easier. You can also email us at {{ shortcode }}@writethedocs.org.

Slack
~~~~~

We'll also be posting the important conference updates on the `#wtd-conferences channel in Slack <https://writethedocs.slack.com/archives/C1AKFQATH>`_. For example, if there are technical issues, we'll share the back-up stream link there as well.

Reception: Your home base
-------------------------

Once you enter the virtual conference, you’ll be at **Reception**. You
can view Reception as your home base for the conference. There’s a
schedule, a list of events happening now, and helpful reminders about
what you can do at the conference.

Don’t be afraid to explore! You won’t interrupt anything by looking
around.

Conference talks and Q&A
------------------------

- There’s a talk schedule on the **Reception** page and on the `Write the Docs website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/schedule/>`__. Select the Calendar icon next to the talks you want to see on the Reception page to add them to your calendar.
- When it’s time for a talk you want to see, select **Stage**.
- If we have problems with our online platform, we will set up a back-up stream. If turned on, we will post links to the back-up stream in the conference chat and on the `conference Slack channel <https://writethedocs.slack.com/archives/C1AKFQATH>`__.
- After a talk, feel free to tweet about it with the hashtag #writethedocs.

Asking questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To attend the moderated Q&A after each talk, go to **Sessions** and select the **Q&A session**.

- Enter your questions into the **Chat** channel (always on the right-hand side of any page) prefixed with “Q:“, and the moderator will ask the speaker for you.
- Make sure the **Session** toggle is on for the Chat, so your question will be seen by the moderator.
- Due to time constraints, we might not be able to get to all of your questions. If your question isn’t asked live, chat with the speaker later and make a connection!

Watching talks after the conference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't worry if you miss something in a talk! Stage talks and Q&A sessions are recorded. Videos will be published in the `Write the Docs Video Archive <https://www.writethedocs.org/videos/>`__ shortly after the conference (typically about a week after the conference ends). To be notified when videos are published, `sign up for our newsletter <https://www.writethedocs.org/newsletter/>`__ or `subscribe to our YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/c/WritetheDocs/?sub_confirmation=1>`__.

Other sessions (such as Unconference, Hallway, and Writing Day sessions) are not recored.

Unconference
------------

- The Unconference is a set of informal sessions that take place all day Monday and Tuesday afternoon. `Unconference talks focus on conversations and exchanges of ideas between participants. <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/unconference/>`__
- You can attend unconference sessions, or, if you have an idea for a session, you can lead one. Anyone can lead an unconference session, as long as they have a discussion idea and a willingness to encourage attendees to talk about it.

Lead an unconference session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Anyone can lead an unconference session, as long as they have a discussion idea and a willingness to encourage attendees to talk about it.
{% if flaghasschedule %}
- Look for an empty slot on the `Unconference sign-up <{{unconf.url}}>`__, and add your Unconference topic. There will be a time and a table number for each slot.
{% else %}
- Look for an empty slot on the Unconference sign-up , and add your Unconference topic. There will be a time and a table number for each slot.
{% endif %}
- When it’s time for your Unconference session to begin, go to **Sessions** and select the session that corresponds to your table number.
- The previous unconference session will be in the same table. Let the attendees of the previous session know that their time is up, and your session will begin soon.
- Once a group has entered your session, start the conversation!
- When the Unconference leader for the next session enters the session, finish up your discussion to make way for the next one.

Tips for your unconference session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Avoid doing roundtable introductions. You might run out of time to actually start the conversation!
- Start the session with a prompt: think of a question that you have about the topic of your unconference and ask it. The conversation typically works itself out after that. If there’s a lull, ask the group if anyone else has a question to ask.
- Up to 20 people can join the session with audio and video, but more people than that may join your Unconference through chat. Be sure to check the session chat regularly and include people there in the conversation.
- Be on the lookout for people who aren’t joining in and invite them to speak. Don’t insist, if they make it clear they want to listen only.

Join an unconference session

{% if flaghasschedule %}
- Starting Monday morning, check the `Unconference schedule <{{unconf.url}}>`__ to see if there are any sessions you are interested in joining. New ones are added all the time, so check back periodically.

{% endif %}
- The session leader will begin when the group has gathered.

Lightning talks
---------------

- A Lightning Talk is a five-minute talk where you quickly share a concept or bit of info you find interesting. Lightning talks are a great way to practice public speaking, get people excited about your Unconference session, and test interest in a conference proposal idea.
- If you are interested in giving a lightning talk, be prepared! There is a great guide `here <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/lightning-talks/?highlight=re>`__.
- Watch the conference chat and **Reception** for an announcement that Lightning Talk sign-ups have opened and for directions on how to sign up.
- If you are selected to speak, one of the Organisers will contact you with more information.

Job Fair
--------

- The Job Fair takes place on Tuesday morning. Each company attending the Job Fair will have their own Session table. To view the Job Fair participants and booths, go to **Expo**.
- Once you are in the session, check out the pinned message to review job and company information.
- If you want to start a conversation with someone at the session, go to the **Chat** tab, make sure the **Expo** toggle is on, and ask your question. You can set up 1:1 conversations using chat or video, too.
- Remember, there might be multiple people starting conversations, so there could be a wait.

Sponsor booths
--------------

Select **Expo** to view Sponsor booths. Sponsors might have videos you can watch, information to review on the **Booth** tab, and people you can talk to on the **Chat** tab. Visiting Sponsor booths is a great way to make connections!

Monday social
-------------

The Monday night Social will be designed by you this year! You can host a session and meet fellow attendees for a video social event or you can attend a social event set up by someone else.

Attend a social event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check the `list of social events <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTnTF98Sa8kqGT8G7zY3g8kTaEF1AqB8P5EfVJbz305s2BelEZo_rMpQzMIcL5Dfe7Ywfvy1ApHGp0Q/pubhtml>`__\ **,** and then go to the **Sessions** page and select the table that you want to join.

Host a social event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have an idea for a social event, find an empty table in the `sign-up sheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IjA2yQWi1qVhopJ8PyG2obMVa5nodIRsggFSJACaWRk/edit?usp=sharing>`__ and add your session. Here’s some ideas:

- Online game night
- WFH life meetup – give attendees a video tour of your space
- Music performance
- YouTube karaoke
- Silly hats/furry friends meetup

Networking
----------

Add info to your profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add information about yourself to your conference profile, select your initials > **Edit Profile**. Share as much as you are comfortable.

Important: Any info you add to your profile can be seen by everyone attending the conference. All conversations should adhere to the `Write the Docs Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__.

Reach out to attendees
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways to network using the virtual conference platform:

Direct message Chat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- You can direct message attendees by finding them on the **People** tab.
- To filter for Organisers or Speakers, select the **Filter** icon.
- You can toggle between viewing **People** (a list of attendees) and **Messages** (a list of the messages you sent and received).

Event and conference-wide Chat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- When you chat on any of the main pages (Reception, Sessions, Networking, and Expo, you are chatting *the entire conference*.
- When you attend a Session, view the main Stage, or visit an Expo booth, you’ll see a toggle for switching between conference-wide chat and event chat. When you select **Event**, you are chatting the entire conference. To chat just your session, toggle on the **Session** or **Booth** chat.

Hallway sessions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under **Sessions** you'll find one or more hallway sessions, for casually talking with other attendees.
You can join with your own audio and video, or chat only.

Here’s some icebreakers:

- What are you reading for fun right now?
- Have you found a website that makes you happy during social isolation?
- If you could start a business, what would it be?
- What is the best vacation you’ve ever been on?
- Are you working on any passion projects right now?
- What are your favorite podcasts?
- What is the most surprising thing that happened to you in the past week?
- What drew you to your work?

Small group video chats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- When you Direct message Chat another attendee, you’ll see a button for starting 1:1 video chat.
- You can start a 1:1 video chat with one person and then send the link to up to two other people, to start a 4-person video chat.
- This is a great way to continue a conversation that started in an Unconference or Hallway session.


Pro tips
--------

- Conferences are exhilarating, but can also be exhausting. Give your brain a break! Grab a quiet spot or take a quick walk. Play a board game on your lunch break. Come back invigorated.
