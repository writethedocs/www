Announcing Call for Proposals and Ticket Sales
===============================================

Today we are announcing our `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/cfp/>`_ and `ticket sales <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/tickets/>`_.

Due to the continuing global pandemic, we are keeping the Australia and India conference online this year as well. The conference will be held on **December 2-3, 2021**.
The Call for Proposals will be open for two months. We know that it hasn't been an easy year. Nevertheless, we'd love to see you on our online stage in December, to share your ideas with our inspiring community of documentarians.

If there is something youâ€™d really like to see a talk about this year, submit a proposal for it or refer someone else who would be good!

Call for Proposals
------------------

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, editor, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

We're hoping that folks who would not be able to travel will be able to join us this time round, both as attendees and as speakers! If you've always wanted to talk about documentation but not been able to travel for whatever reason, now is the time.

You can read our full `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/cfp/>`__ on the website.
The Call for Proposals will be open until **Midnight {{tz}} on {{cfp.ends}}**..

Tickets
-------

Tickets are now on sale! Take a look at the new prices for the online conference on our `Tickets <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/tickets/>`_ page. We have made it even more affordable for students and unemployed documentarians to be a part of this conference this year.

Opportunity Grants
-------------------

Our grant program offers tickets to people who would otherwise not be able to attend.
We're excited to be able to offer free tickets to a larger number of people this year, since there are now minimal other costs to attend the event.

You can apply until **October 15, 2021, Midnight AEDT** on `our website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2021/opportunity-grants>`_.
