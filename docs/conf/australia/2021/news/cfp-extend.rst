Call for Proposals Extended
===========================

Greetings fellow documentarians!

The conference is now just under four months away, and we hope you’re already planning for this year's remote installment of Write the Docs Australia and India conference.

New deadline to submit your proposal is 31st Aug
--------------------------------------------------

We added two extra weeks to the deadline because there are enough things to worry about this year, and we wanted to give as many of you the opportunity to prepare your submissions.
Make sure to get your talk in before the new deadline; we already have a lot of great proposals coming in, but we wanted to give everyone a chance to submit their ideas.

Check out the `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2021/cfp/>`_ page for tips and examples to help inspire you.
And if you’ve got an idea but aren't sure what to do with it, feel free to ask for feedback on `Slack <http://slack.writethedocs.org/>`_. Your fellow documentarians will be happy to help!

We will send out the decision emails to all who submitted by **mid-September**, and the final talks will be published by **early October**.

We'll have more to share soon
-------------------------------

We are working through all the other aspects of the event. Expect to hear more about the welcome reception, social event, and more in the next few months.
This will be our fifth Australian conference, and second one for the Indian community, and we can't wait!
