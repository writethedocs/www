Run of Show
===========
{% if not flagrunofshow %}

The Run of Show will be published closer to the event.

{% else %}

This Run of Show provides more context about the event and answers some common questions you may have.
Please let us know if there is any information missing that would be useful for you.

Sponsorship platform
--------------------

We will be using `Hopin <https://hopin.to/>`_ as our online conference platform. It has multiple unique spaces for attendees during the conference, and we hope it will allow for a good amount of interaction between attendees and sponsors.

We will open the online platform 1 week prior to the conference starting. You will be able to create an account and be assigned roles by us, but it won't become fully active until the day of the conference.

Sponsorship spaces
------------------

A quick overview of the important spaces in the "venue":

* The *main stage* is where the talks happen. This is also where Lightning talks will be given.
* The *Sessions area* is where the Writing Day, Unconference and Social event will happen.
* The *Expo area* is where sponsors will be able to have booths available. You can provide videos that will play whenever attendees enter your booth, as well as chat or video-call directly with attendees.

Sponsorship events
------------------

Sponsor booths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sponsor booths are only available for our larger sponsors.
You will be given a booth that is in the *Expo area* of the online platform.
Most of the attendee focus will come during breaks between talks and at the beginning and end of the day.

**Logistics**: You can record a video to play at your booth when attendees enter the booth, but we generally recommend having someone with the Expo hall tab open to answer any questions that attendees might have. We also recommend that you answer general questions in the main booth and then break off into private calls or chat to talk in more depth to specific people.

How do I get the most out of my sponsorship?
--------------------------------------------

Come prepared to engage with our community, and to learn just as much as you teach. Engage with our event as attendees as well as sponsors. Send technical staff who can chat with people on the interesting things your company is doing, and get value from the vast amount of insight in the room. We do have some decision makers in the room, but soft sells will work better than hard sales in the environment we strive for.

Who is my primary contact?
--------------------------

Swapnil Ogale will be your primary contact, but our team is available at australia@writethedocs.org. If you have a time sensitive inquiry, please email the entire team to ensure a timely response.

During the conference itself, we will also have a *help desk* available on the Hopin platform.
You can find staff members there to ask any additional questions you might have.


How do I use my sponsorship tickets?
------------------------------------

You should have received a unique URL with a discount code for your sponsorship tickets. We are happy to send it over again, just ask!

How do I use my job postings?
-----------------------------

You can post your jobs to our `job board <https://jobs.writethedocs.org/>`_.
You will be given a discount code that will let you post them for free,
please ask us for this if you don't have it!
They will be published in our :doc:`Newsletter </newsletter>` every month,
and displayed on our website as well.

What does the platform look and feel like?
------------------------------------------

You can see a demo of the platform in this video.
It's currently linked to the expo hall demo,
but it has demos of all the other areas as well:
