Workshop: Let's create a Style Guide!
======================================

This workshop is for writers who have never used, or don't currently have, a
Style Guide in place.

We'll briefly demonstrate the importance of a Style Guide
through practical examples, and then we’ll look at some real-life Style Guide
varieties before we launch into creating a Style Guide on the spot, through a
collaborative workshop.

Expect to learn more about the “correct” way to write
headings, use capital letters, express dates, times and numbers and much more!
