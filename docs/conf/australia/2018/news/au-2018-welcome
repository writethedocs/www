Announcing Australia Website, CFP, and Ticket Sales
================================================

Welcome to the official kick-off of `Write the Docs Australia 2018 <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2018/>`_!
It’s shaping up to be another wonderful year full of great conversations and interesting talks.

Today we are launching our `website <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2018/>`_, `call for proposals <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2018/cfp/>`_, and `ticket sales <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2018/tickets/>`_.

Website
-------

As per our tradition of website optimization, this year's website is even more friendly and lively!
We've included (hopefully) all the information you need to plan your visit to Australia, such as venue location and a schedule overview.

As with all things on the web, there are likely to be a few lingering bugs with the design.
Feel free to reach out to us by replying to this email, or emailing us at australia@writethedocs.org if you see any issues!

Tickets
-------

Ticket prices and descriptions are available on our `Tickets <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2018/tickets/>`_ page. Last year we had 50 attendees, and this year, we are planning to host 100-120 attendees across 2 days in a new location.

We believe that everyone who cares about this topic has a place at our event, and we keep ticket prices low so that it is accessible to the widest range of people possible.
However, if you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend, please email us at australia@writethedocs.org, and we can work on getting you reduced price tickets or volunteer options.

As with the previous years, we have tiered pricing to make it fair for everyone.
Please buy the ticket that best fits your situation.
Tickets are `on sale now <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2018/tickets/>`_.

Call for proposals
------------------

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
Whether you’ve been writing documentation for decades or you’ve just started, we want to hear from you!

The `Call for Proposals <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2018/cfp/>`_ page now has all the information that you need to prepare and submit your proposal.

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our inspiring community of documentarians.
If there is something you’d really like to see a talk on this year, submit a proposal on it, or refer someone else who would be good!

The Call for Proposals will be open until **Midnight AEST, 20th July 2018**.

Conclusion
----------

We hope you will join us in Melbourne, Australia for the first full Australian Write the Docs conference.
Whether as a speaker or attendee, you can bet it will be another delightful year!
