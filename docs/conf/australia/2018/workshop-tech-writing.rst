Workshop: Tech Writing 101
==========================

As part of the *Write the Docs Australia 2018* conference, we're running a
two-hour workshop on the principles and techniques of technical writing.

Operations manuals, design docs, code comments, email messages, post mortems...
writing things down for others is an unavoidable part of the life of an
engineer, a UX designer, a product manager, and, of course, a tech writer.

The workshop leads you through a series of pair-work exercises to improve the
clarity, readability, and effectiveness of your writing. You'll learn from an
experienced Google technical writer and from each other.

By the end of the session you'll also think differently about toothbrushes.

Before attending the workshop, you need to do a small amount of pre-reading
(~30 minutes reading about basic technical writing concepts):

During the workshop, you'll apply the principles you’ve read in the prework.
We've found this method of learning is highly effective. And it's just plain
fun. The workshop has been run at SREcon in Europe 2017 and at SREcon in the US
in 2018, where it was very well received. People said they came away with
useful skills and cleaner teeth.

Who's welcome
-------------

All conference attendees are welcome! The workshop is intended for people who
want to understand the basic principles and techniques of technical writing. The
workshop material is tailored for engineers, and is suitable for new
technical writers, editors, UX designers, and anyone else interested in
technical communication.

Experienced technical writers are sure to enjoy the content too, both as a
refresher and as a reminder of how debatable technical language can be.

The workshop format is highly discursive and entertaining. You'll find yourself
debating the principles as you apply them. The material is designed to
stimulate such discussions.
