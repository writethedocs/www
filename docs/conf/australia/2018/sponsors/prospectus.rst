Concept
=======

Write the Docs Australia (http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2018/) is a
two day conference focusing on documentation systems, tech writing theory,
and information delivery.

Writing and maintaining documentation involves a multidisciplinary community
of technical writers, designers, librarians, typesetters, developers,
support teams, marketers and many others. This group of people can be
collectively referred to as “documentarians”.

Write the Docs creates a time and a place for this community to share
information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve the art and
science of documentation.

For too long, people who care about documentation have felt alone in the
world, not able to connect with their community. Write the Docs is a
magical experience for many of our attendees, allowing them to feel
like they have found their place. We believe this is the most important
thing that our event can do, and we aim to provide that experience
in Australia this year, and make it better than ever.

Demographics
============

Last year, we organised a one day event in Australia, that was attended by
50 people.

This year we are planning a 2 day conference, full of talks, workshops and unconference
sessions and are expecting around 100-120 people to attend.

We hold two conferences yearly, one in Portland, USA in May, and one in
Prague, Europe in September. Attendance is approximately 400 in the USA
and 300 in Europe, and we both conferences have sold out last two years.
We are also hosting our first WTD conference in association with Open Help at Cincinaati, Ohio in August 2018.

Our audience is made up of:

- Technical Writers (40%)
- Developers (22%)
- Support Staff (15%)
- Managers (12%)
- Community Contributors, Enthusiasts & Other Folks (11%)

This will be first of its kind Write the Docs conference to be organised in
Australia and we want to make this a regular event on our documentation calendar.

Why Sponsor
===========

By supporting a Write the Docs event, your company will gain not only
visibility and credibility with front-line documentarians, but also
valuable insights that will help you get the most out of your own documentation
efforts. If you're hiring for docs positions, Write the Docs is also an
excellent opportunity to meet top-notch talent.

Our conferences and events are run by teams of volunteers, and we work hard
to keep ticket prices affordable for a broad range of attendees. Your
sponsorship makes it possible for all sorts of documentarians to attend our
events, whether they're a freelancer, a student or out of work. Becoming a
sponsor demonstrates your commitment to and support of good documentation,
and the people who build it.
