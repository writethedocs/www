Concept
=======

Write the Docs Australia (https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2018/) is a
two day conference focusing on documentation systems, tech writing theory,
and information delivery.

Writing and maintaining documentation involves a multidisciplinary community
of technical writers, designers, librarians, typesetters, developers,
support teams, marketers and many others. We sometimes refer to this group of
people as “documentarians”.

Write the Docs creates a time and a place for this community to share
information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve the art and
science of documentation.

For too long, people who care about documentation have felt alone in the
world, not able to connect with their community. Write the Docs is a
magical experience for many of our attendees, allowing them to feel
like they have found their place. We believe this is the most important
thing that our event can do, and we aim to provide that experience
in Australia this year, and make it better than ever.

Demographics
============

Last year, we organised a one day event in Australia, that was attended by
50 people.

This year we are planning a 2 day conference, full of talks, workshops, and
unconference sessions. We expect around 100-120 people to attend.

Write the Docs holds other annual conferences, including one in Portland, USA
in May, and one in Prague, Europe in September. Attendance is approximately 400
in the USA and 300 in Europe. Both conferences have sold out last two years.
We are also hosting our first WTD conference in association with Open Help at
Cincinnati, Ohio in August 2018.

Our audience is made up of:

- Technical writers (40%)
- Developers (22%)
- Support staff (15%)
- Managers (12%)
- Community contributors, enthusiasts & other folks (11%)

Why Sponsor
===========

By supporting a Write the Docs event, your company will gain not only
visibility and credibility with front-line documentarians, but also
valuable insights that will help you get the most out of your own documentation
efforts. If you're hiring for docs positions, Write the Docs is also an
excellent opportunity to meet top-notch talent.

Our conferences and events are run by teams of volunteers, and we work hard
to keep ticket prices affordable for a broad range of attendees. Your
sponsorship makes it possible for all sorts of documentarians to attend our
events, whether they're a freelancer, a student, or out of work. Becoming a
sponsor demonstrates your commitment to and support of good documentation,
and the people who build it.
