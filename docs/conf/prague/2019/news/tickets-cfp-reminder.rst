Announcing Ticket Sales and Call for Proposals Reminder
=======================================================

Greetings, fellow documentarians in Europe and beyond! We're happy to launch ticket sales for Write the Docs Prague 2019 and give you a quick reminder that our Call for Proposals is still open.

Tickets are on sale!
--------------------

Ticket prices and descriptions are available on our `Tickets <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2019/tickets/>`_ page. Last year we sold out at 280 attendees, and due to venue capacity we are only able to increase our available tickets to 300, to help our attendees feel comfortable in this beautiful venue.

We believe that everyone who cares about documentation and communication has a place at our events, and we keep ticket prices low so that the event is accessible to the widest range of people possible.
However, if you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend, please email us at prague@writethedocs.org, and we can work on getting you reduced price tickets or volunteer options.

As with the previous years, we have tiered pricing to make it fair for everyone.
Please buy the ticket that best fits your situation.
Tickets are `on sale now <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2019/tickets/>`_.

Following the success of our swag update last year, your conference ticket will include our delightful bags, which were extremely popular. We will launch print-on-demand t-shirt sales separately soon, stay tuned for updates!

Call for proposals reminder
---------------------------

Thank you so much to all who submitted their proposals so far! Our Call for Proposals is still open until **Midnight CET, 30th April 2019**. Make sure to get your talk in before the deadline!

The `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2019/cfp/>`_ page has tips and examples to help inspire you.
And if you have an idea but aren't sure what to do with it, feel free to ask for feedback on `Slack <https://writethedocs.org/slack/>`_. Your fellow documentarians will be happy to help!

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our inspiring community of documentarians.
If there is something youâ€™d really like to see a talk on this year, submit a proposal on it, or refer someone else who would be good!

We're also super excited with the work our friends in `Vilnius <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2019/cfp/>`_ are doing to launch their first-year event, so if you can't wait until September or simply want more Write the Docs European events, check out their website and Call for Proposals (open until **20th April, 2019**).

We hope you will join us in Prague for the sixth European Write the Docs conference.
Whether as a speaker or attendee, you can bet it will be another delightful year!
