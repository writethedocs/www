   WTD {{city}} {{year}} -- speaker logistics

::

   Hi folks!

   Just wanted to drop you all a quick note covering some logistics. 

   * I've added some questions to our CFP tool (Pretalx) for you about your pronouns, interesting facts and name pronunciation. Please log in at https://pretalx.com/write-the-docs-portland-2021/login/ and answer those (although we'll only need them closer to the event). 

   * If you haven't done so already, please upload a speaker pic to your Pretalx account, it'll look so much better than the anonymous outline.

   * Private speaker slack channel! If you're not on the slack already, [join the WTD slack](https://join.slack.com/t/writethedocs/shared_invite/enQtNzQ2NzkwODQ3NDkwLWZhY2U4YTg5YjAyODk1NzkxYzI0ZmFjOWMxNWEwOWNjZDE3NDZjMmJiZTlkODc4Y2ZlNjkxNGIyNzMxNDkzZjA). Once you're signed up, or if you're already on there, ping me @plaindocs so I can add you to the private speaker channel. It contains all of our past speakers, who will be happy to offer advice or answer questions.

   * [Speaker mentoring guidelines](https://www.writethedocs.org/organizer-guide/confs/cfp/#speaker-mentoring) -- let us know if you'd like to talk over your proposal or slide deck with a speaker from a previous year. 

   * While you're working on your talks, we'd love for you to check out our updated [Speaking Tips](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/speaking-tips/) page! It's got all sorts of details on talk format, tech specs, content guidelines, etc.

   Also, if you're ever in doubt about whether something you're writing would be appropriate or not, we'd like to refer you to our conference Code of Conduct, which asks that you refrain from any sexually suggestive or harassing language of any kind. Check it out in full, drop me a line if you have questions: http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/

   Looking forward to emailing with you all over the coming months.

   Sam

   WTD {{city}} {{year}} -- talk recording

::

   Hi Folks,

   Here are the important details you've been waiting for! I'll get into specifics below, but first the important ones:

   - [ ] we'd love you to upload your recorded talk by the **3rd of September**, or soon after. If you're likely to need more time, please let  me know in advance where possible.
   - [ ] we have folks who can help you record online, both in US and EU time zones, if this is of interest just let me know and I'll get a slot booked. [Recording guidelines](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/talk-recording-guidelines/).
   - [ ] as well as the tips in the recording guidelines we've updated the [speaking tips](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/speaking-tips/) for virtual confs as well.

   Now those essentials are covered, a little more info about the event itself:

   * We'll be using [Hopin](https://hopin.to/) for the event, over the coming weeks we'll get you account details so you can update head-shots and taglines on there in the coming weeks. 
   * We'll be live captioning as usual, and closer to the event I'll ask for copies of your slides to make the captioners work easier.
   * In a change from our in person event, we'll be hosting moderated Q&A in a separate Hoping room, directly after each talk.

   Next week I'll send over a provisional schedule, and if having a particular slot would make it easier to attend the Q&A let me know and I'll see what I can do.

   And while we're here, ;-) if you don't have a profile picture set in [Pretalx](https://pretalx.com/write-the-docs-portland-2021/login/), now would be a great time to add one.

   And I think that is it! I'm excited to see this taking shape and excited to see all of your hard work on the virtual stage!

   Please get in touch if I can help with anything, if you have worries, thoughts or ideas.

   Sam
