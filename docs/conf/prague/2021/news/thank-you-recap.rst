Conference highlights and thanks to the community!
==================================================

Hey everyone,

The Write the Docs team is now emerging from the post-conference recovery period, and we wanted to send out a quick message to thank everyone for helping to make our conference such a success. 
We appreciate everyone who makes the conference possible: speakers, sponsors, organizers, and attendees alike.

Conference recap
----------------

At **nearly 300 attendees**, the conference was active and full of usual mix of talks on the main stage along with Q&A, lightning talks, unconference sessions, writing sprints, social event, and job fair. 
We thought everything went pretty smoothly this year, including experiments like the new social event platform.

As always, we were excited with how our awesome community come together in our virtual venue. Lots of knowledge was shared, and we had a great time.

Talk videos
-----------

Videos of the talks are now available on `YouTube`_. This includes all conference talks and Q&A, as well as the lightning talks.
You can also subscribe to our `YouTube channel`_ so you don’t miss any future content.
We are also working to add the videos and sketchnotes for all the talks to our website archive, so stay tuned for updates.

Thanks again to all our presenters and moderators! Huge thanks also to `Bart at Work`_ for handling the A/V production on our event, it was flawless once again this year.

Shirts still on sale

We have loose and fitted options from different fabrics, and you can choose exactly the size and cut you want. The campaign will run in 3-day batches for another few weeks. Shipping is available from the USA or Europe.

**New this year**: You can shop for non-conference swag in our `Write the Docs Community Shop <https://writethedocs.threadless.com/>`_ on Threadless. 
We have non-apparel options like stickers, notebooks, bags, and other accessories with various community slogens (including the now-famous "Docs or it didn't happen!"). 

Code of Conduct transparency report
-----------------------------------

As with any Write the Docs event, this conference was covered by our `community Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__. 
We aim to be as transparent with CoC incidents and enforcement as we can.

To ensure that our CoC was visible and accessible, we took a number of specific steps:

- Every participant agreed to the Code of Conduct in advance during registration.
- The CoC, or a summary, was included on the conference website and Hopin Reception
- The CoC was repeatedly mentioned in our conference introduction and announcements.
- We specifically stressed that the CoC applies to all conference spaces including the social event.
- We encouraged all attendees to report any incident, even if they were not sure whether it was a violation.

None of our organizers were approached about any CoC concerns at this event.
We know that this is, in part, a reflection of the thoughtful and inclusive community that we're so lucky to have.

That being said, we're also very conscious of the fact that just because nothing was reported doesn't mean nothing happened. 
If there was any personal conduct or other aspect of the conference experience that did not meet the expectations of behavior set out in the CoC, please email us at `conduct@writethedocs.org <mailto:conduct@writethedocs.org>`_.

Keep in touch
-------------

As you probably know, we've decided to take a break this year from a full Australia & India conference, to help the organizers maintain their well-being and prevent burnout. 
Instead of the conference, we're organizing a more casual super-meetup instead. Stay tuned for details soon!

We’re also looking for more sponsors to make our other events just as magical as this year’s Prague event. 
You can see all our `sponsorship options <https://www.writethedocs.org/sponsorship/>`__ on our website.

Our Slack network has expanded yet again this year. 
Our #general Slack channel has been extra busy in the days and weeks leading up to the conference, and we hope that y'all continue the conversations throughout the year. 
If you haven't joined, now's the time! Check out the `Write the Docs Slack <https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`__.

Our `monthly newsletter <https://www.writethedocs.org/newsletter/>`_ is the other place to keep track of everything that is happening with the community.
Subscribe to make sure you hear about all the conferences, meetups, job postings, and summaries of relevant conversations in our Slack.
