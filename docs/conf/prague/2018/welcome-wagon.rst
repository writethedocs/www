Welcome Wagon
=============

Hello!

We're Beth and Daniel, your Welcome Wagon! We're glad you're coming to the {{year}} Write the Docs conference!

.. image:: /_static/conf/images/pics/welcome-wagon.jpg

We've gathered important stuff here that will help you navigate the conference like a pro, make you feel more at home, and help you to manage the constant flow of information.

The Welcome Wagon events warm up new attendees and connect them with people, both veterans
and other first-timers. Strategies and pro tips provide ways you can make the most of the conference.

The `FAQs <#faq>`_ should have answers to most of your questions, but let us know if there is anything you'd like to know that isn't there. You can ask us questions in the :doc:`#wtd-conferences channel on Slack </slack>` or you can send `Daniel <mailto:daniel@ddbeck.com>`__ or `Beth <mailto:beth.s.aitman@gmail.com>`__ an email.

Pro Tips
--------

-  You don't need to go to every talk. Look through the schedule of
   events before you arrive or while you are eating or taking a break.
   Figure out which talks you want to see the most. Spread out your time
   between talks, unconference sessions, networking, and breaks.
-  Speaking of breaks--conferences are exhilarating, but can also be
   exhausting. Give your brain a break! Grab a spot in the quiet room
   or take a quick walk. Play a board game on your lunch break. Come
   back invigorated.
-  Starting Monday morning, check the unconference schedule in the unconference
   room to see if there are any sessions you are interested in
   attending. New sessions are added all the time, so check back
   periodically.
-  Eat! You can use the energy.
-  Are you looking for a job or is there an opening at your company?
   Check out the job board in the unconference room.


FAQ
---

.. contents::
   :local:

**Where is everything?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The conference main stage is in the Auto Klub on the second floor. The unconference
takes place directly across the foyer in the adjoining room.

If you are joining in the boat tour on Saturday, you'll meet the other folks
at the Prague Boats pier no. 5.

**How should I get around?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Prague is a very walk-able town. Most of the events are
   within walking distance of the conference venue.
-  There are good public transportation options and taxi services. Check
   out the `Visiting Prague section of the Write the Docs
   website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/visiting/>`__ for
   more info.

**How should I dress?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Praguers have a very eclectic dress style, which means they dress however
   they feel! Our documentarians tend to go for a more casual dress at the
   conference. You'll be meeting business colleagues at this conference,
   though, so neat and comfortable are good dress guidelines.
-  If you are going on the `Write the Docs boat tour on
   Saturday <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/outing/>`__, be sure
   to bring appropriate out-of-doors clothes and shoes. Prague, like most of
   Europe, experiences some ups and downs in the autumn. The first year we
   were here we had a heat wave, and last year we got rained on, so you
   never know! Layering is usually the way to go.

**What will I eat?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Drinks and food are provided for you on conference days, so you can
   focus on the talks and meeting people and don't have to worry about
   where to get your morning coffee.
-  Coffee, tea, and water are always available in the Auto Klub.
   Bring a water bottle to make it easier for you to stay hydrated.
-  Food is provided on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday in the Auto Klub. There
   is a light breakfast, a solid lunch, and snacks on each conference
   day.
-  On Saturday and in the evenings on Monday and Tuesday, explore the food
   options in Prague. Invite someone you just met to join you! If you are
   invited to dinner, say yes! Making connections over dinner is a great way
   to get to know more people.
-  If you need grocery items, there is a BILA supermarket at the Prague train station
   across the park from Auto Klub.

**Where should I sit?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The Auto Klub will have round tables next to the main stage
   and rows of seats behind them. There will also be seats in the mezzanine level.
-  There are no reserved seats; feel free to sit anywhere.
-  If you can, show up early to the conference each morning to grab a
   seat at one of the round tables. Introducing yourself to your
   neighbors is one of the easiest way to meet people.

**What should I do during the talks?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Conference talks at Auto Klub <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/speakers/>`__

-  The time between talks is for meeting your colleagues or taking a
   break. During the talks, listen and take in as much as you can.
-  There is a lot of great information at this conference, but don't
   worry if you miss something! All talks are videotaped, so you can
   review them later.
-  If you have a question during a talk, make a note of it and use it as
   a conversation starter with the speaker after the talk.
-  After a talk, feel free to tweet about it with the hashtag
   #writethedocs. Try not to "watch" the conference through Twitter and
   other social media, though. You are attending the conference, so live
   in it as much as you can!

**Unconference**

-  Check the schedule posted in the unconference room for the table number of the
   unconference talk you are interested in. Head to that table and have
   a seat.
-  The session leader will begin when the group has gathered.
-  Feel free to just listen or add your voice to the discussion.
   Unconference talks are designed to get everyone involved.

**How do I take part in the unconference?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The unconference is a set of informal sessions that take place across the foyer
   from the main stage on Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning.
   `Unconference talks focus on exchanges of ideas between
   participants. <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/unconference/>`__
-  You can attend unconference sessions, or, if you have an idea for a
   session, you can lead one.
-  To lead an unconference session, post a summary of your topic on a
   post-it note in an empty spot on the unconference schedule. Make your
   way to the unconference room a few minutes early to introduce yourself to
   anyone who is attending your session. Once the group has gathered,
   introduce your topic and get the discussion going.

**What are lightning talks, and should I give one?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  A lightning talk is a five-minute talk where you quickly share a
   concept or bit of info you find interesting.
-  Lightning talks are a great way to practice public speaking, get
   people excited about your unconference session, and test interest in
   a conference proposal idea.
-  Do you have an idea, want to talk about a new tool you are learning,
   or review a process? Then, yes! Sign up for a lightning talk. There
   will be a sign-up sheet at registration.
-  If you are interested in giving a lightning talk, be prepared! There
   is a great guide
   `here <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/lightning-talks/?highlight=re>`__.

**How do I make the most out of this conference?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attend the Welcome Wagon events. Make connections with other first-time
attendees and get advice from seasoned pros.

The most important part of this conference (and any conference) is the
people you meet. Set a goal for yourself to meet a few new people. Here
are some tips:

-  Find out who is attending the conference before you get there. Join
   the `Write the Docs Slack <https://writethedocs.org/slack/>`__, follow
   the `Write the Docs on Twitter <https://twitter.com/writethedocs>`__,
   and review the `list of
   speakers </conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/speakers/>`__.
-  Figure out which companies will be represented at the conference. If
   you see a job post you're interested in, you might want to ask them a
   few questions. This might be a great time to better understand what
   it's like to work at certain companies.
-  Make a list of a few people you would like to meet, and write down
   some questions for them. If you can find contact information, email
   them before the conference and let them know you are looking forward
   to chatting.
-  Most importantly, remember that you don't have to meet everyone. In
   fact, you shouldn't. You should plan to make a few, meaningful
   connections. That is what the Write the Docs conference is about, so
   go for it! Introduce yourself.

**Sample strategy for my first Write the Docs conference**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Join the `Write the Docs Slack <https://writethedocs.org/slack/>`__,
   and participate in the Welcome Wagon chat room to start making
   conference connections.
-  Make a list of two people who are attending with some notes about
   them and questions for them. Either reach out by email before the
   conference to set up a meeting onsite or find them at the conference.
-  Attend the Welcome Wagon events.
-  Join in the Saturday boat tour.
-  Attend the Sunday writing day and volunteer to help on one of the projects being worked on.
-  Check out the talk schedule in advance and make note of the talks you
   don't want to miss.
-  In the morning, or when you need a break during the day, head over to
   the unconference room to check out the unconference schedule. Make note of any
   unconference talks you want to attend.
-  Check out the lightning talks, and get excited about presenting one
   at next year's conference.

**Sample strategy for a second or higher Write the Docs conference**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Attend the Welcome Wagon events and share your conference knowledge.
   You might learn something new yourself!
-  Reach out to some first-time attendees and tell them about your first
   conference.
-  Attend the Sunday writing day with your own project. Ask for help!
-  Check out the talk schedule in advance and make note of the talks you
   don't want to miss.
-  In the morning, or when you need a break during the day, head over to
   the unconference room to check out the unconference schedule. Make note of any
   unconference talks you want to attend.
