Concept
=======

Write the Docs (http://www.writethedocs.org/) is a
**three day conference** focusing on documentation systems, tech writing
theory, and information delivery.

Writing and maintaining documentation involves a multidisciplinary
community of technical writers, designers, librarians, typesetters, developers,
support teams, marketers and many others. This group of people can be
collectively referred to as “documentarians”.

**Write the Docs** creates a time and a place for this community to
share information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve the art
and science of documentation.

For too long, people who care about documentation have felt alone in the
world, not able to connect with their community. Write the Docs is a
magical experience for many of our attendees, allowing them to feel like
they have found their place. We believe this is the most
important thing that our event can do, and we aim to provide that
experience again this year, and make it better than ever.

Demographics
============

We hold two conferences yearly, one in Portland, Oregon in May, and one in
Prague, Czech Republic in September. Attendence is approximately 400 in the
USA and 300 in Europe, and we expect both conferences to sell out.

Our audience is made up of:

- Technical Writers (40%)
- Developers (22%)
- Support Staff (15%)
- Managers (12%)
- Community Contributors, Enthusiasts & Other Folks (11%)

Why Sponsor
===========

By supporting a Write the Docs event, your company will gain not only visibility
and credibility with front-line documentarians, but also valuable
insights that will help you get the most out of your own documentation efforts.
If you're hiring for docs positions, Write the Docs is also an excellent
opportunity to meet top-notch talent.

Our conferences are run by teams of volunteers, and we work hard to keep ticket
prices affordable for a broad range of attendees. Your sponsorship makes it
possible for all sorts of documentarians to attend our events, whether they're a
freelancer, a student or out of work. Becoming a sponsor demonstrates your
commitment to and support of good documentation, and the people who build it.
