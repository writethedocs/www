Call for Proposals Extended
===========================

Greetings fellow documentarians!

The conference is now just under four months away, and we hope you’re already planning for the latest installment of Write the Docs in Prague!

Tickets are already going fast and folks are chatting in the #wtd-conferences and #prague `Slack channels <https://writethedocs.org/slack/>`_ about their travel plans, so feel free to get some tips for your trip and `grab your ticket soon <https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-prague-2018>`_.

New deadline to submit your proposal is 31st May
------------------------------------------------

The `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/cfp/>`_ is now extended until **31st May 2018 at Midnight CET** – We added two extra weeks to the deadline because so much has been going on at Write the Docs Portland!
Make sure to get your talk in before the new deadline; we're already excited to see lots of great proposals coming in, but we wanted to give everyone a chance to submit their ideas.

Check out the `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/cfp/>`_ page for tips and examples to help inspire you.
And if you’ve got an idea but aren't sure what to do with it, feel free to ask for feedback on `Slack <https://writethedocs.org/slack/>`_. Your fellow documentarians will be happy to help!

We will send out the decision emails to all who submitted by **mid-June**, and the final talks will be published by the **end of June**.

We'll have more to share soon
-------------------------------

We are putting the finishing touches on all the other aspects of the event. Expect to hear more about the boat ride, writing day, welcome reception, social event, and more in the next few months.
This will be our fifth European conference, and the fourth one in Prague, and we can't wait!
