Welcome to Write the Docs Prague 2018!
======================================

Yet another edition of Write the Docs Prague nearly upon us! We're excited to see you all in just a few days.

Below you'll find all the practical information you need to plan for and navigate the event and activities.

Be Prepared
-----------

* **Read the Welcome Wagon Guide.** Our `Welcome Wagon Guide <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/welcome-wagon/>`_ is packed full of information on how to get the most out of the conference. There will also be a few Welcome Wagon events that will help you learn more about the conference.
* **Review the schedule.** The `Schedule Page <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/schedule/>`_ has the latest and most complete information about the presentations and activities. This is where we will also update any changes or cancellations if they occur.
* **Review the Code of Conduct.** We have a wonderful community full of diverse and amazing people. We expect everyone to behave in a respectful manner at all conference events and online channels. Our `Code of Conduct <http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`_ boils down to "Be excellent to each other", but the `full text <http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct>`_ is also available. Our mobile numbers and email addresses are on that page if you ever need to contact us.
* **Review the Venue information.** Our `Venue Page <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/venue/>`_ for information about accessibility and orientation. If you have any specific accessibility questions, please email us at prague@writethedocs.org and we will be happy to do our best to make the event as accessible as possible. This year we are launching *live captioning* for all presentations, and priority accessibility seating will be available near the stage.

Get Involved
------------

* **Plan a project for Writing Day.** The `Writing Day <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/writing-day/>`_ will be held on Sunday from *9:00-17:00*, and you can drop in at any time during the day. If you have a project you want to propose to others, you can pitch your topic during the welcome announcement that will be held at *10:00*. Check out the `Writing Day <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/writing-day/>`_ page for a few suggested projects.
* **Plan a lightning talk.** We'll have `lightning talks <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/lightning-talks/>`_ each day after lunch. These are 5 minute presentations and a lot of fun. They can be about anything you want; this is your chance to share something you are passionate about with the audience. Slides are not required.
* **Get ready for the Job Fair**. New this year, on Tuesday morning we'll have a `job fair <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/job-fair>`_ where you can find your next documentarian-friendly job.
* **Plan an unconference session.** We'll be running the `Unconference <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/unconference/>`_ all day Monday and on Tuesday afternoon. Want to chat with like-minded folks about a very specific thing? This is the place. We'll have a sign-up board so you know what's happening, and supplies to help you brainstorm.
* **Coffee, breakfast, and lunch are provided on all three days!** Don't worry about coffee before you come to the conference on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday. Coffee and breakfast are served at *9:00* each day, and the conference programme starts at *10:00*.

Find Your Way Around
--------------------

* **Getting around Prague.** Public transit is generally excellent in Prague, and there are private rides and taxi options too. For more information, see our `Visiting Prague page <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/visiting/>`_, which has all the details you need to get around.
* **Where to go? What do do?** This year we are launching a special volunteer role, *Visiting Prague Coordinator*, who will be available on Slack to advise you on the best places to eat, drink, and be merry in town. Feel free to reach out to Jakub Mikuláš (*@gak* on Slack) for pro-tips and recommendations.

Have Fun
--------

* **Join us for the boat ride.** If you're planning to come for the `boat ride <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/outing/>`_ on Saturday at *13:45*, make sure you `register in advance <https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-prague-2018/>`_ . **We are almost at capacity for the boat**, so if you're on the fence, grab your ticket now! Registrations for the boat ride will close on *Friday, September 7th*.
* **Pre-register at the welcome reception.** The meet-and-greet event will be held on Sunday from *17:00-20:00*. You can pick up your badge and enjoy a drink and a snack on us. This is a great chance to meet your fellow documentarians before the conference starts.
* **Relax at the social event on Monday night.** This is a private evening event only for conference attendees. Plan to attend so you can get to know folks in the community. We will be at `Hoffa Bar, Senovážné Náměstí 22, Prague 1 <https://goo.gl/maps/b1egvQhoDxt>`_ on *Monday evening from 20:00*, with free snacks and drinks.
* **Participate in the badge flair contest.** What started as an unofficial activity is now a conference tradition. The `Badge Flair Contest <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/badge-flair/>`_ is a fun way to make the most out of your badge flair. We look forward to seeing your creative decorations!

Share the Love
--------------

* **Slack with your fellow documentarians.** Feel free to use our `Slack <http://slack.writethedocs.org/>`_ to coordinate dinners, ask questions, or share notes with fellow conference attendees. Please use #wtd-conferences or #prague channels for group discussions.
* **Use the Twitter hash tag #writethedocs.** Twitter is a great way to communicate at events. If you arrive to Prague early and want to find others, use the hash tag `#writethedocs <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23writethedocs&src=tyah>`_.

We're so excited to welcome you all to Prague in just a few days – see you there!
