Conference highlights and thanks for attending!
===============================================

Hey everyone,

Our team is now emerging from the post-conference recovery period, and we wanted to send out a quick message to thank everyone for helping to make our conference such a success. 
We appreciate everyone who makes the conference possible: speakers, sponsors, organizers, volunteers, and attendees alike!

Conference recap
----------------

At **over 200 attendees** this conference was a welcoming and friendly event.
We had the usual mix of talks on the main stage along with Q&A, lightning talks, unconference sessions, writing sprints, social event, and job fair.
We thought everything went pretty smoothly this year; we're getting pretty good at virtual events!

Talk videos
-----------

`Videos of the talks`_ are now available on YouTube. This includes all conference talks and Q&A, as well as the lightning talks.
You can also subscribe to our `YouTube channel`_ so you don’t miss any future content.

Thanks again to all our presenters, moderators, and folks who asked wonderful questions!
Huge thanks also to `Bart at Work`_ for handling the A/V production on our event, it was flawless once again this year.

Write the Docs Slack
--------------------

Our Slack network has really grown more this last year. Our #general Slack channel has been extra busy in the days and weeks leading up to the conference, and we hope that y’all continue the conversations throughout the year. If you haven’t joined, now is the time! 
Check out the `Write the Docs Slack`_.

Write the Docs Newsletter
-------------------------

Our `monthly newsletter`_ is the other place to keep track of everything that is happening with the community. 
Subscribe to make sure you hear about all the conferences, meetups, job postings, and summaries of relevant conversations in our Slack.

Local Meetups
-------------

We hope you continue to `build your local or online communities`_ and keep in touch with other documentarians. 
We have a number of meetups in cities across the country, and if you don’t see your city listed consider `starting`_ a meetup!

New this year are our `Quorum Meetups`_ which are virtual and targeting large geographic areas. There’s already one covering most everyone in the US or in a similar timezone.

Code of Conduct transparency report
-----------------------------------

As with any Write the Docs event, this conference was covered by our `community Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__.
We aim to be as transparent with CoC incidents and enforcement as we can.

To ensure that our CoC was visible and accessible, we took a number of specific steps:

- Every participant agreed to the Code of Conduct in advance during registration.
- The CoC, or a summary, was included on the conference website and Hopin Reception
- The CoC was repeatedly mentioned in our conference introduction and announcements.
- We specifically stressed that the CoC applies to all conference spaces including the social event.
- We encouraged all attendees to report any incident, even if they were not sure whether it was a violation.

None of our organizers were approached about any CoC concerns at this event.
We know that this is, in part, a reflection of the thoughtful and inclusive community that we're so lucky to have.

That being said, we're also very conscious of the fact that just because nothing was reported doesn't mean nothing happened. 
If there was any personal conduct or other aspect of the conference experience that did not meet the expectations of behavior set out in the CoC, please email us at `conduct@writethedocs.org <mailto:conduct@writethedocs.org>`_.

Thanks again
