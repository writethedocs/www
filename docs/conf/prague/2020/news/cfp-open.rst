Announcing Prague Call for Proposals and Ticket Sales
=====================================================

Today we are announcing our `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/{{year}}/cfp/>`_ and `ticket sales <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/{{year}}/tickets/>`_.

Due to the global pandemic we've moved the Prague conference online, and changed the dates to 18-20 October 2020.
This means that we're only leaving our Call for Proposals open for one month. We know that it hasn't been an easy year. Nevertheless we'd love to see you on our online stage in October, to share your ideas with our inspiring community of documentarians.

If there is something you’d really like to see a talk about this year, submit a proposal for it or refer someone else who would be good!

Call for Proposals
------------------

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, editor, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

We're hoping that folks who would not be able to travel to Prague will be able to join us this time round, both as attendees and as speakers! If you've always wanted to talk about documentation but not been able to travel for whatever reason, now is the time.

You can read our full `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/{{year}}/cfp/>`__ on the website.
The Call for Proposals will be open until **Midnight {{tz}} on {{cfp.ends}}**.

Tickets
-------

Tickets are now on sale! Take a look at the new prices for the online conference on our `Tickets <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/{{year}}/tickets/>`_ page.

If you previously purchased a ticket to our Portland conference and chose to convert your ticket to a virtual conference pass, you'll receive an email from us in the next weeks to confirm your registration to the Prague virtual conference.

Opportunity Grants
------------------

Our grant program offers tickets to people who would otherwise not be able to attend.
We're excited to be able to offer free tickets to a larger number of people this year,
since there are now minimal other costs to attend the event.

You can apply until **September 1, 2020, Midnight CEST** on `our website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2020/opportunity-grants/>`_.
