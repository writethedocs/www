Opportunity grants
==================

The grant program for WTD {{ name }} 2020 supports people who would otherwise not be able to attend the conference by covering attendance costs. Applications are open to anyone who wants to attend Write the Docs.

{% if grants.url %}
To apply, fill in the form below.
{% else %}
We expect to open the grant program around the same time as ticket sales.
{% endif %}
As the conference is virtual this year, the grant offers you a single free ticket to the conference.

Depending on the number of applications, we may not be able to provide every applicant with a free ticket. We prioritize applications based on the overall impact that granting an application will have on the applicant, the Write the Docs community, and the applicant's wider community and country, compared to others.

Grant applicants, like all other participants in the Write the Documents community, are required to conform to the Code of Conduct: https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/.

{% if grants.ends %}
**Grant applications are open until {{ grants.ends }}, Midnight {{ tz }}.**
