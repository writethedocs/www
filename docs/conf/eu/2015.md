# About

Join 200 people for a two-day event to explore the art and science of
documentation. You can look forward to learning more about
documentation systems, tech writing theory, information delivery, and
more. Past talks have also covered such diverse topics as typography,
empathy, and [Wabi-sabi][wabisabi].

Write the Docs brings *everyone* who writes the docs together in the same room:
Writers, Developers, Designers, Support Folks.
We all have things to learn from each other, and there's no better way than 
sitting together and talking.

The conference takes place on **August 31 - September 1 (Monday and Tuesday) from
9am to 6pm** in beautiful Prague, Czech Republic. Our venue, [Klub Lavka][klub-lavka],
sits right on the bank of the Charles river, overlooking the Charles bridge, in the
historical city center of Prague.

We will also hold a meet-and-greet reception on the Sunday before the conference,
as well as a city tour if folks are interested (you can indicate this when you register).

    <h4>Keynote: The Federated Wiki</h4>
    <p>
      Just as the first wiki changed how people write, our new wiki will change
      how people work. By pushing steadily on two fundamental ideas,
      refactoring to ease improvement and federation to ease sharing, we have
      once again uncovered a simpler and more powerful internet.

#### City tour - Sunday morning

sights that Prague has to offer. The tour is free for attendees but requires registration,
so please indicate on your registration form whether you would like to attend.

#### Conference Reception - Sunday evening

Come early, get your badge and get to know other attendees.

#### Official Party - Monday night

Wind down and talk about the days talks in a relaxed and friendly environment.
