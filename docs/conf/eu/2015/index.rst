About
=====

Join 200 people for a two-day event to explore the art and science of
documentation. You can look forward to learning more about documentation
systems, tech writing theory, information delivery, and more. Past talks
have also covered such diverse topics as typography, empathy, and
`Wabi-sabi <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi>`__.

Write the Docs brings *everyone* who writes the docs together in the
same room: Writers, Developers, Designers, Support Folks. We all have
things to learn from each other, and there's no better way than sitting
together and talking.

The conference takes place on **August 31 - September 1 (Monday and
Tuesday) from 9am to 6pm** in beautiful Prague, Czech Republic. Our
venue, `Klub Lavka <http://www.lavka.cz/en/s>`__, sits right on the bank
of the Vltava river, overlooking the Charles bridge, in the historical
city center of Prague.

We will also hold a city tour and a meet-and-greet reception on the
Sunday before the conference.

and historical sights that Prague has to offer. The tour is free for
attendees but requires registration, so please indicate on your

We will meet **in front of Club Lavka at 12 NOON**, and end the tour at
3 PM. Please be on time! The tour will be operated by English-speaking
guides from the Prague City Tourism association, and will include
historical and cultural sights around Praha 1, 2, and 5.

After the tour you can continue to the `Prague Ice Cream
Festival <https://www.facebook.com/events/911013742295892/>`__ (not
