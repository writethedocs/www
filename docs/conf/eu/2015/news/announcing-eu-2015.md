# Announcing Write the Docs EU 2015

We are excited to announce the 2015 EU conference!

in **Prague, Czech Republic on August 31 - September 1, 2015.**
* The conference will be held at **Klub Lavka** in the Praha 1 historical city center.

### Conference

Join us for a two-day event to explore the art and science of documentation.
You can look forward to learning more about documentation systems, tech writing theory, information delivery, and more.
Past talks have also covered such diverse topics as typography, empathy, and [Wabi-sabi][wabisabi].

The main event takes place on August 31 - September 1 (Monday and Tuesday) from 9am to 6pm.
Our venue, [Klub Lavka][klub-lavka], sits right [on the bank of the Charles river](https://goo.gl/maps/OHjne), 
is located in the historical city center of Prague, overlooking the Charles bridge.

### Auxiliary Events

Write the Docs is more than a conference.
Each year we organize other events so that people can get to know each other better.
These events are optional, but we strongly recommend you come into town Saturday or early Sunday to participate.

This year, these events will include:

* City Tour (Sunday morning) --- Join us for a walking tour of the old city center around the beautiful and historical sights that Prague has to offer.
* Conference Reception (Sunday evening) --- Come early, get your badge, and get to know other attendees.
* Official Party (Monday night) --- Wind down and talk about the day's talks in a relaxed and friendly environment.
