# Announcing More Events, Sponsors, Ticket Updates

Just three short weeks until our Prague conferences, and we hope you're getting as
excited as we are! Here is some up-to-date information about tickets,
city tour, and partner events.

### Ticket Sale Ends on August 20

Thank you to everyone who registered for the conference! We have a handful of
corporate and independent tickets available, and to allow us some time to prepare your
swag and badges, we will **end the ticket sales on August 20th**.

Friends-and-Family tickets will still be available until 3 days before the conference
starts, and we will maintain a waiting list in case of cancellations, but now is the time
to grab the last tickets before they're gone!

### Walking City Tour - Sunday Morning (Aug 30)

Join us for a walking tour of the old city center around the beautiful and historical
sights that Prague has to offer. We will meet [in front of Club Lavka](https://goo.gl/maps/gfMnC)
at 12 NOON, and end the tour at 3 PM. Please be on time!

The tour will be operated by English-speaking guides from the Prague City Tourism
association, and will include historical and cultural sights around Praha 1, 2, and 5. After the
tour you can continue to the [Prague Ice Cream Festival](https://www.facebook.com/events/911013742295892/) (not included in the conference ticket).

**NOTE FOR TICKET HOLDERS:** Due to limited tour group size, we will be able to accommodate
only confirmed attendees and friends-and-family ticket holders. Please adjust your RSVP for the city
tour if you changed your mind, so that we can plan the number of guides accordingly.

To change your RSVP, locate your ticket email confirmation, click the **Change Details** button,
and then change your answer to the city tour question. Please update your answers no later
than **August 23rd**.

### GitHub Patchwork (Partner Event) - Saturday Night (Aug 29)

Our friends at GitHub will be hosting a Patchwork on Saturday August 29. This is an independent
event organized by GitHub and is open for everyone (based on availability and capacity).

Some information from GitHub about the Patchwork event:

_Patchwork is a self-directed, hands-on workshop for learning Git and GitHub featuring
community mentors, talks from documentation and open source community members, and snacks._

_Newcomers to Git and GitHub: you'll leave with a merged pull request, a square on your
contributions graph, and confidence to get more involved in the open source community._

_Mentors: if you've ever had a pull request merged, now is your chance to share the love
and help someone else create magic._

Register at <https://ti.to/github-events/patchwork-prague>.

This event requires separate registration and isn't organized by Write the Docs or included
in conference tickets or friends-and-family tickets.
