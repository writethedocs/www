Thanks for coming to Write the Docs Europe 2015
===============================================

Hi everyone,

Thanks for attending our second Write the Docs Europe conference in Prague! We're so grateful to our sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and attendees for making the conference possible.

We hope you had a wonderful time, and that you are as excited as we are about the beautiful community that is forming. Below we've included all of the resources you might need for staying in touch, such as notes and a forum. We also have a short anonymous survey for you to fill out, so we can make the conference even better next year.

### Tell us how we did

Let us know how we can improve for future conferences and gatherings. We really appreciate your candid feedback!

**Our two question survey is quick and easy, so [go fill it out](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_xCQxnoQMvUY-3EefUyrZYWgS8kpwVlGgabLy0MVtg4/viewform).**

### Speak or sponsor next year's conferences

In the next few weeks we will announce the locations and dates for our 2016 conference in North America and Europe,
but it's not too early to prepare talk proposals. We're also hoping to start a speaker mentoring program, so stay tuned for details if you've never spoken at a conference before!

We're also looking for more sponsors to make next year's events just as magical as this year. If you are curious about sponsoring EU or NA next year,
please contact us at [sponsorship@writethedocs.org](mailto:sponsorship@writethedocs.org).

### Videos and notes

All the videos are currently being processed, please follow us on Twitter, Slack, or join our mailing list
to be notified when they are published.

In the meantime, check out the [comprehensive notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XhHMXaqV3UvVp-ltNZZEVdfiQFzY5adYQwBiiC-rk_4/edit) taken by one of our attendees [Sarah Chambers](https://twitter.com/sarahleeyoga). Thank you for the wonderful and helpful coverage!

### Join our forum

Thanks to our awesome community member [Sharon Campbell](https://twitter.com/captainshar), we now have a [Write the Docs Forum](http://forum.writethedocs.org/).

We hope that this forum will serve as the easiest way to share information with the community. Join the forum, and feel free to start a topic or chime in on an existing thread.

### Meetups

We hope you continue to build the community and keep in touch with other documentarians in your hometown. In this spirit, a few of our amazing community members are starting meetups in various cities around Europe. If you don't see your city listed, consider starting a meetup!

If you want to start a meetup in your city, [send us an email](mailto:europe@writethedocs.org) and we'll help you get started and spread the word.
