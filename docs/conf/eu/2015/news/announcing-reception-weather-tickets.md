# Announcing Talk Schedule, Reception, Weather, Ticket Updates

Our conference is less than ten days away, and we're happy to share some more information
for you to prepare for the big day.

### Talk Schedule is Published

The [final talk schedule](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/schedule/) for the
conference is now live on our website. We are excited to see and hear our wonderful
speakers talk about all things docs!

### Conference Reception - Sunday Evening (Aug 30)

Come early, get your badge and get to know other attendees. The reception is hosted by our
friends at [Apiary](https://apiary.io/company#contact) at their lovely new office
in [Praha 8](https://goo.gl/maps/L7wCE).

The reception will start at **6 PM** and will include drinks and light snacks. This event is
not included in the friends-and-family ticket.

### Weather Information

The forecast: European! We recommend packing your sunglasses and your umbrella, so that you
are prepared both for higher temperatures and for occasional light showers. All our venues
are indoors, but wind breakers and layers will be useful when walking between venues and
especially during the city tour.

### City Tour RSVP Reminder

If you registered for the conference and would like to join the city tour on Sunday morning,
please make sure that your RSVP is up-to-date. We can only accommodate ticket holders who
confirmed attendance, and friends-and-family ticket holders.

To change your RSVP, locate your ticket email confirmation, click the **Change Details** button,
and then change your answer to the city tour question. Please update your answers no later
than **August 23rd**.
