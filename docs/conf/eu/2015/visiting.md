## Traveling to Prague

Prague has many direct rail, bus, and flight connections to most major European cities. 
In the summer, there are also direct transatlantic flights to/from New York (JFK) and 
several other US airports.

### Flights

Prague's [Vaclav Havel airport](http://www.prg.aero/en/) provides many direct and low-cost
flights with airlines such as Czech Airlines, Ryanair, Wizz Air, Air Berlin, Norwegian... 
You get the idea. To get from the airport to the city center, you can either take a bus 
(average journey time 30 minutes, cost ~30czk) or a taxi (average journey time 15-20 minutes
depending on traffic, cost ~500czk).

### Trains

Prague's main train station (Hlavni Nadrazi / hl.n) is a central railway hub, with direct
trains to Germany, Poland, Austria, and Hungary. We recommend train lines by EuroCity (EC), 
InterCity (IC) or RailJet (RJ). You can even take a train from Denmark
 [inside a ferry!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogelfluglinie)

To look up train connections, head over to the [ČD Website](https://www.cd.cz/eshop/default.aspx).

### Buses

Prague is a popular destination among backpackers and shoestring travelers,
so there are many affordable bus options if you are traveling within Europe. 
The biggest Czech bus company [Student Agency](http://www.studentagency.eu/) operates direct
bus lines between Prague and cities like Berlin, Vienna, Zagreb, Munich, etc. Global companies like
[Eurolines](http://www.eurolines.com/en/) operate direct lines to many European cities.

## How to get around

Prague is a very accessible city and there are many transportation
options available, public and otherwise.

### Navigating in Prague

If you navigate by smartphone, Google Maps is the most popular method to calculate
routes and travel times. Do exercise caution when calculating walking routes, as the
city center has many gated walkways that are locked at night. 

### Trams, buses, and metro

The [Prague Public Transit Co.](http://www.dpp.cz/en/) runs an extensive network
of trams, buses, and 3 metro lines. You can buy a single ticket, day ticket, 
or 5-day pass at ticket machines, Trafika stands (tobacconists) and at the train and
bus stations. 

If you're flying into Prague Airport (PRG), you can take bus number 100, 119, or the
Airport Express (AE) bus. Depending on where you are staying, these bus lines
will connect you to several major metro stations as well as the main train station.

### Taxi companies

Prague does have Uber but it's still pretty young and rides are not easily located.
However, there are several reliable local taxi companies:

* [AAA Taxi](http://www.aaataxi.cz/en/)
* [Tick Tack](http://www.ticktack.cz/en)
* [FIX Airport Taxi](http://www.airportcars.cz/?page=o-nas&lang=en)

IMPORTANT: Do not hail/flag taxis in the city center. As with most major European cities,
taxi scams do occur and can be easily avoided by calling in advance or using an official taxi
stand/rank (these are marked with a _TAXI_ sign and a posted fact sheet in Czech and English).
