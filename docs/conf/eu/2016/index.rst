About
=====

Join 250 people for a three-day event to explore the art and science of
documentation. You can look forward to learning more about documentation
systems, tech writing theory, information delivery, and more. Past talks
have also covered such diverse topics as typography, empathy, and
`Wabi-sabi <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi>`_.

Write the Docs brings *everyone* who writes the docs together in the
same room: Writers, Developers, Support Folks. We all have things to
learn from each other, and there's no better way than sitting together
and talking.

The main presentation track takes place from **September 19-20 (Monday and
Tuesday) from 9am to 6pm**.
