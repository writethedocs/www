About
=====

Join 250 people for a three-day event to explore the art and science of
documentation. You can look forward to learning more about documentation
systems, tech writing theory, information delivery, and more. Past talks
have also covered such diverse topics as typography, empathy, and
`Wabi-sabi <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi>`_.

Write the Docs brings *everyone* who writes the docs together in the
same room: Writers, Developers, Support Folks. We all have things to
learn from each other, and there's no better way than sitting together
and talking.

The main presentation track takes place from **September 19-20 (Monday and
Tuesday) from 9am to 6pm**. Each afternoon we will also host an unconference
room in parallel to the main presentations, where you can break away to open-space
sessions, workshops, hackfests, or smaller discussions.

Our venue will be the `Auto Klub <http://www.ganimed.cz/>`_ right next to the train
station in the Prague city center. Inspired by the Crystal Ballroom, the main presentations
will be held in (you guessed it) a ballroom, and the unconference sessions will be held in
adjoining rooms.

The venue has a long history and beautiful architecture, as well as a few surprises!
Auto Klub is accessible with an internal lift and ramps from the street level.
