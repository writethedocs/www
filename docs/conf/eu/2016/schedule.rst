Schedule
========

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Each year we organize a wide
range of events so that people can come together, collaborate, and learn
from each other in different ways.

Saturday, September 17th
------------------------
If you're in town early, we'll organize some sight-seeing activities to introduce
you to this lovely city and to meet other documentarians who will be around.

Sunday, September 18th
----------------------

During the day, we’ll hold our :doc:`Writing Day documentation
sprints </conf/eu/2016/writingday>` at the same venue as the rest of the conference, followed by the conference reception in the evening.
We encourage everyone to drop by on Sunday evening for the conference reception.

You’ll have a chance to get acquainted with each other over some drinks and snacks.
We’ll also help groups organize dinner plans, so you can continue your conversations
over more substantial food as well.
