Tickets are going fast and Talk Proposals are due soon
======================================================

Greetings fellow documentarians!

The conference is now just over three and a half months away, so we hope you’re already planning for the latest installment of the amazing Write the Docs in lovely Prague, Czech Republic!

Early Bird tickets are now sold out. Thanks to everyone who has already purchased a ticket. We do expect the conference to sell out fully, so get `your tickets now <https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-eu-2016/>`_.

Submit your talk by June 10th
===================================

There is still time to submit your talk to Write the Docs! The `Call for Proposals <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2016/cfp/>`_ is open until **June 10th at Midnight PST** – we've added an extra week to the deadline because so much has been going at WTD NA and Pycon! So make sure to get your talk in.

Remember, too – on the `Call for Proposals <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2016/cfp/>`_ page, we’ve got some tips and examples to help inspire you. And if you’ve got an idea, but you’re not sure what to do with it, ask for feedback on `Slack <http://slack.writethedocs.org/>`_. Your fellow documentarians will be happy to help!

We will be announcing the conference program by **July 1st**.
