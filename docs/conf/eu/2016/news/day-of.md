# Welcome to Write the Docs

Hello Documentarians,

All of us organizers are in Prague, and we're getting excited to spend some time with all of you!
Here is the info you need to plan your days here,
all in one place. 

## Info

* If you have signed up for the **boat trip**, join us on Saturday the 17th at Prague Boats,
  [pier no. 5 of Dvořákovo nábřeží](https://goo.gl/maps/bqLP3VaytVo). Boarding is
  at **13:45**, don't be late! **Small snacks will be provided, bring cash (czk) for any drinks you want to purchase.** The trip lasts for two hours, and will feature an English-speaking guide.
* **Join us on Sunday** for the [Writing Day](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2016/writingday/) at the main venue, [Auto Klub, Opletalova 1337/29](https://goo.gl/maps/FctuHxqXkr52). Breakfast and lunch will be provided, so come eat with us! It runs [*09:00 to 17:00*](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2016/schedule/), so bring a laptop and join awesome projects like the Mozilla Developer Network in getting some docs written.
* The **Reception** is immediately following Writing Day, at [Auto Klub, Opletalova 1337/29](https://goo.gl/maps/FctuHxqXkr52) from *17:00-19:00*. You can pick up your badge and enjoy a couple of drinks on us. This is a great chance to meet your fellow documentarians before the conference starts.
* **Follow the [Code of Conduct](http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/)**. We have a wonderful community full of diverse and amazing people. We expect everyone to behave in a respectful manner at all conference events. Our code of conduct boils down to "Be excellent to each other", but the [full text](http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/) is also available.

* **Come to the party on Monday night.** This is a private party just for conference attendees. Plan to attend so you can get to know folks in the community. We'll be at [Klub Lavka, Novotného lávka 201/1](https://goo.gl/maps/3k5XZQvkHZr), our awesome conference venue from last year! Party time is 19:00-23:00, light snacks and various beverages provided.
