We're putting the finishing touches on the conference.
Write the Docs is all about community,
so we make sure you have a lot of time to connect with other documentarians.
We hope you'll be able to join most if not all of the events outside the main conference talks,
because they're some of our favorite parts of the event.

Conference Schedule
-------------------

The [schedule][schedule] for the conference is now fully filled out.
We're excited about the talks, Writing Day,
and all the other wonderful festivities we have every year.

Sunday - Writing Day and Conference Reception
---------------------------------------------

During the day on Sunday, at the [conference venue][autoklub-map], we'll have our [Writing Day][writing-day], followed by the reception in the evening.

The Writing Day is modeled after the concept of ["sprints"][sprints] from
the open source and software development world. The idea is simple: to get a
bunch of interesting people in a room together and have them work towards shared
goals.

We encourage everyone to drop by on Sunday evening for our conference reception.
You'll have a chance to get acquainted with each other over some drinks and
snacks, plus it's a great place to find some folks to grab dinner with,
so you can continue your conversations over more substantial food.
