We’ve got a brand new venue, `Auto Klub <http://www.ganimed.cz/>`_, and are preparing an awesome lineup of documentation talks. Read on for more details on the conference, as well as the exciting auxiliary activities leading up to the main event.

The Conference
---------------

If you’ve been to Write the Docs before, you know that you’re in for some of most thought-provoking and inspirational days of your professional year. And if you haven’t been yet, join us! We’d hate for you to miss out!

Every year we assemble a group of exceptional speakers to discuss the art and science of documentation. You’ll learn about the latest in documentation tools, tech writing theory, content delivery, and more. In the past, we’ve had talks on topics ranging from poetry to continuous deployment, from typography to API reviews.

Write the Docs Europe will be happening in **Prague, Czech Republic**, from **September
18-20, 2016**.

In addition to the conference itself, we have a host of auxiliary events to round out your Write the Docs experience.

Auxiliary events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Write the Docs is so much more than a conference—it’s a rare and golden opportunity for documentarians to interact with our community in-person. Every year we organize a handful of side events to augment the main conference, making it easier for attendees to get to know each other.

All of these events are optional, but we’d strongly recommend you come into town Saturday or early Sunday so you can participate.

This year, our auxiliary events will include:

- **Visit Prague** (Saturday Daytime TBC) --- Join us on a special visit of beautiful Prague.
- **Writing Day** (Sunday Daytime) --- Kicking things off the day before the conference, our Writing Day is all about, y’know, writing the docs! Meet up with your fellow documentarians either to collaborate on your own projects or contribute to open source projects like `Wordpress <http://codex.wordpress.org/>`_ or the `Mozilla Developer Network <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/>`_. This is an awesome opportunity to share your knowledge and learn from your peers.
- **Conference Reception** (Sunday Night) --- Come early, pick up your badge, and get to know other attendees.
- **Official Party** (Monday Night) --- Wind down and discuss the first day's talks in a relaxed and friendly environment.

Tickets
-------

We believe that everyone who cares about this topic has a place at our
event. We keep ticket prices low so that it is accessible to the widest
range of people possible.

This year, our ticket prices will ensure that the absolute cost of the
conference is covered, with revenue from sponsorships used to extend the
conference and make it substantially more awesome.

If you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend, please email
us at prague@writethedocs.org, and we can work on getting you reduced
price tickets.
