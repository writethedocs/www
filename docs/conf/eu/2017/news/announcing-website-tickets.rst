Announcing our Website and Ticket Sales
=======================================

We're happy to officially announce `Write the Docs Prague 2017 <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/>`_!
It’s shaping up to be another wonderful year full of great conversations and interesting talks.

Today we are launching our `website <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/>`_
and `ticket sales <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/tickets/>`_.

Since the `Portland Call for Proposals <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/cfp/>`__ is
still in full swing, we are holding the Prague one until the Portland sessions are announced.

Website
-------

If you noticed the shiny new `Portland conference website <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/>`_,
we're happy to say that the `Prague conference website <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/>`_
now also provides a friendlier, more navigable online home for our event.

The website includes (hopefully) all the information you need to plan your visit to Prague,
including venue location, schedule overview, and information about the different events.

As with all things on the web, there are likely to be a few lingering bugs with the design.
Feel free to reach out to us by replying to the email,
or emailing us at europe@writethedocs.org if you see any issues!

Tickets
-------

You can see our 2017 ticket prices on our `Tickets <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/tickets/>`_ page.
Since last year was the first time at Auto Klub, we capped registrations at 200 people, but this year
we are happy to increase the capacity to allow even more happy documentarians to attend!

We believe that everyone who cares about this topic has a place at our
event. We keep ticket prices low so that it is accessible to the widest
range of people possible. We have slowly raised prices over time to make
the event more sustainable to run, but we still feel they are quite reasonable and
below the market rate for the experience we provide.

If you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend, please email
us at europe@writethedocs.org, and we can work on getting you reduced
price tickets or volunteer options.

As with the previous years, we have tiered pricing to make it fair for
everyone.
Please buy the ticket that best fits your situation.
Tickets are `on sale now <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/tickets/>`_.

Conclusion
----------

We hope you will join us in Prage for the fourth annual Write the Docs Europe.
Whether as a speaker or attendee, you can bet it will be another delightful year.
