# Announcing Write the Docs Kenya 2025

We're excited to announce the dates for our first official Kenya conference!
There was a Kenya Summit last year, and this year it's being expanded into a full conference.

**Write the Docs Kenya 2025 will be on 7th June**

We'll be in Nairobi for another year full of great talks, networking, and community building.

## Call for proposals

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience. [**Submit your talk proposal through our CFP**](https://sessionize.com/wtdkenya-conf/) if you're ready or start thinking about topics to present!

## Sponsorship

We are working to revamp our sponsorship program for this year based on feedback from last year. We will be announcing our new sponsorship levels soon, but if you are already excited about sponsoring, reach out to us at sponsorship@writethedocs.org.

We're always open to customization or new ideas for our sponsorships.
