# What is an Unconference?

The Unconference consists of attendee-driven sessions that provide the opportunity for anyone who is attending the conference to lead, contribute, share ideas, and discuss problems in an organized setting away from the main stage talks. Many attendees consider this one of their favorite aspects of the conference.

**Who can lead an Unconference session?**

Everyone! All attendees are invited to lead a session on a topic. Sessions can be organized around a presentation, group discussion or anything in between.

## Leading a Session

Sessions take place at tables and focus on small group interaction. There is no stage at an Unconference session.

**How do I structure my Unconference session?**

- **Group discussion:** Pick a topic and facilitate a discussion
- **The semi-talk:** Use a short presentation to lead into a group discussion on a topic
- **Show and tell:** Share your latest project, a new tool, or anything else that excites you
- **Presentation:** Sessions are meant to be small and inclusive, so a presentation can be a difficult format. You will not have access to a large screen, so you cannot rely on slides. You may present a longer talk, but expect more interaction from others joining the session, and break often for questions and discussion.

These ideas were borrowed from Scott Berkun. Read more of his [post on Unconference sessions](https://scottberkun.com/2006/how-to-run-a-great-unconference-session/).

**Tips to keep in mind:**

- **Good sessions emphasize group participation.** However, if you choose a format that includes a lot of your own ideas or material, be prepared to dial it back and use what you have as a starting point, not as the focal point.
- **Aim to keep your sessions manageably small.** Most sessions are typically 5-12 people. 
     - If your group is larger than this, split it into two groups if possible, reconfigure, or remove tables. Ask Unconference staff/volunteers for assistance. 
     - If you’re leading a session on a popular topic (notably API docs in the past), consider scheduling an early time so there’s the possibility to schedule overflow sessions later in the day, or the following day.
- **Whoever attends are the right people.** You can get great results with 5 or 30 people, and sometimes it’s better to have a smaller, but more engaged group.
- **People may come and go during the session and that’s okay!**
- **Keep an open mind.** Even though the session starts out with a topic, you may end up with a different outcome.
- **Ask Unconference staff/volunteers for support to wrangle logistics.** The room can get crowded especially when a popular topic is scheduled.
- **When it’s over, it’s over.** There are time slots to help organize the sessions but you can finish early or continue the discussion elsewhere.
