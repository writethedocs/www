# Venue

Our conference will be held at [Revolution Hall](https://www.revolutionhall.com/), a beautiful venue located in the thriving inner east side of Portland. It was originally a high school, and was converted into the versatile space it is today, including an 800+ seat auditorium, coffee shop, bar/restaurant, rooftop bar, rooms to support events, and local businesses. It still has some lockers in the hallway for that extra ambiance.

More information will be shared in January regarding venue spaces and accessibility.
