# Attendee Guide
The Attendee Guide provides conference information and gives strategies and tips for all attendees (new and experienced) to get plugged in and connect with others! We’ve gathered info here that will help you navigate the conference like a pro and make you feel more at home.

## Where Can I Ask a Question?
Go to our Registration table! There will always be a member of our Welcome Wagon Team stationed here and available during all conference hours.

Whether you have a question about the schedule, where to eat, or how to connect with other attendees, they are your go-to for conference questions. If they don’t know the answer, they’ll find someone who does.

## Welcome Wagon Tour
Join us for an introduction to Write the Docs. We’ll go on a short tour of the venue and review information about the conference. The tour is designed to give attendees the information they need to feel comfortable at the conference. This also gives everyone a chance to meet someone new. Bring any questions you may have.

Welcome Wagon Tour is scheduled for: 

- Monday at 8:45 (meet near Registration)

## Tips to Have a Great Conference

- [Join the Write the Docs Slack!](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/) This is the main way for attendees to stay connected, make plans, and ask questions during the conference. This requires you complete a sign up form so we highly encourage you sign up before the conference begins.
- Follow Write the Docs on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/18284823/admin/page-posts/published/), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/writethedocs.bsky.social), and [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@writethedocs).
- Attend the Welcome Wagon tour!
- Engage with other attendees, volunteers, staff, and speakers.
- Don’t forget to use Eric Holscher’s [Pac-Man Rule](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/) to leave room for others to join! 
- Engage with the Snowball Rule. For every year you've attended, we encourage you to meet one new person. The most important part of this conference (and any conference) is the people you meet. 
- Set a goal for yourself to meet a few new people.
- Review the [Speaker Schedule](/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/speakers/) and choose which talks you want to attend the most. Spread out your time between talks, unconference sessions, networking, and breaks.
- Check the [Unconference](/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/unconference/) schedule regularly (this will be shared during the conference). People add new sessions all the time.
- Give yourself and your brain a break! Conferences are exhilarating, but can also be exhausting. Grab a seat in the Wintergarten, visit one of the Communal Rooms for a break, or take a quick walk.
- Eat! There will be snacks available inside the conference but there are many restaurants close by.
