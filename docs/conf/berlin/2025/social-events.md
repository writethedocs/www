# Social Events

Write the Docs is a community conference,
which means a big part of the experience is meeting and getting to know other documentarians.
Along with the talks and Unconference sessions,
we have a few social events planned to help you connect with other attendees.

## Monday Social

Join us for our Monday night social event! This is a great chance to meet more of your fellow documentarians 
and chat about the conference in a relaxed atmosphere.

**Where**: {{about.social_venue}}  

**When**: Monday, 19:00–21:00

**Bring**: Your badge, as this will be required for entry.

*Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and snacks will be provided.*
