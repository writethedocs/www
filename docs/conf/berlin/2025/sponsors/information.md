## Sponsorship Benefits During the Conference

Each sponsorship includes different opportunities to engage with our attendees. View further information below on specifics to sponsor booths, Writing Day, Unconference, and Lightning Talks. 

### Sponsor Booths

Sponsor booths are setup in the main hallway on Monday and Tuesday outside of the auditorium. Attendees are always looking for great products to use in their day to day workflows, and are curious to learn more about your company.

**Logistics**:

* **WTD provides**: Each sponsor receives an 8 foot table, 2 chairs, and access to power and wifi. You must provide your own linen.
* You are responsible for loading in and loading out your entire booth setup.
* **Recommendations**: We encourage you to bring a table linen with your company logo and laptop or tablet to show off your product. Some sponsors bring a banner frame to place behind their table. Check in with the Sponsorship Coordinator for specific setup questions.
* **Arrive early for setup**: Sponsor arrival is 7am on Monday; the conference venue opens at 8am. We recommend arriving on time to be set up for attendee arrival.
* **The most important times to be present at your booth are during the breaks and at the start of lunch break.**
* **Bring swag (especially stickers)**: We recommend bringing a variety of swag to give away. Stickers are by far the most popular item for our attendees.
* **Engage with folks as both a sponsor and attendee**: This is a great opportunity to meet folks in the community, so we recommend engaging with folks in an official capacity, but also as a regular attendee.
* **Use QR codes**: QR codes are a great way to get people to a website quickly. We recommend using a service like <https://www.qr-code-generator.com/> to create these.

### Lightning Talks

If your sponsorship includes a Lightning Talk, you will be given 60 seconds to present on the main stage. This is a great way to introduce your company to the entire audience.

**Logistics**:

* Your 60 second introduction will occur on Monday or Tuesday, after lunch and before Lightning Talks begin.
* If you want to use a slide for your introduction, let us know. Otherwise, we will create a slide with your logo.

### Writing Day

Writing Day is on Sunday and modeled after the concept of “sprints”. This is a place where the community gathers to get actual work done. This is a great opportunity to get small group and extended interaction with attendees.

**Logistics**:

* Sessions are on Sunday in the morning, afternoon, or all day.
* View our [Lead a Project](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/writing-day/#lead-a-project) for more information.
* [Submit your Writing Day project here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeHMZ1uXTfnT0HMm-KfsgxYV1w3tmS7bMPtBx4H9cktJpSrdg/viewform?usp=dialog) All projects submitted by April 23 will be published to our website, which encourages attendees to attend, engage with your product, and contribute to your documentation.

You are always welcome to introduce your project to attendees during the Writing Day introduction on Sunday morning.

### Unconference

The Unconference provides the opportunity for sponsors and attendees to lead, contribute, share ideas, and discuss problems in an organized setting away from main stage talks.  

**Logistics**:

* Sessions are 40 minutes in length on Monday and Tuesday.
* We will confirm your time slot with you before the conference begins.
* View more on how to Lead a Session on our [Unconference](/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/unconference/) page.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I get the most out of my sponsorship?

Come prepared to engage with our community, and to learn just as much as you teach. Engage with our event as attendees as well as other sponsors. Send technical staff who can chat with people on the interesting things your company is doing, and get value from the vast amount of insight in the room. We do have some decision makers in the room, but soft sells will work better than hard sales in the environment we strive for.

### Who is my primary contact?

Eric Holscher will be your primary contact, but our team is available at <sponsorship@writethedocs.org>. If you have a time sensitive inquiry, please email the entire team to ensure a timely response.

If you have questions during the conference, check in with our Executive Producer Katie Janovec or our Welcome Wagon team at registration. You will find staff members there to answer any additional questions you might have.

### How do I use my sponsorship tickets?

You should have received a unique URL with a discount code for your sponsorship tickets. We are happy to send it over again, just ask!

### How should I send my booth materials?

* Patron sponsors are allowed to send 3 boxes at 24"x18"x18" in size. Please contact us for the shipping address for an organizer, as the venue doesn't accept packages.
* Packages must arrive between 1 and 2 weeks before the conference.
* Sponsors are responsible for all sponsorship materials after they arrive at the venue. 
* Sponsors are responsible for mailing all materials after the conference. 
* Please print your return shipping labels prior to coming to the venue to send your materials back.
* **All materials must be out of the venue by 6pm on Tuesday**

If you have any further questions, reach out to Eric Holscher or <sponsorship@writethedocs.org>.
