## Volunteer Roles

### Writing Day

- Assist the Writing Day coordinator, direct attendees to specific tables, and support writing day project leads with logistical questions.

### Registration

- Check in attendees, provide general information inquiries, answer venue questions, and field other requests or direct individuals to the correct staff member who can provide support.

### Stage Support

- Assist presenters while on stage - troubleshoot issues with slides, video, or audio portions of their presentation. Please apply for this role if you have some A/V knowledge; it is not required, but experience with different operating systems is a plus!

### Unconference

- Assist the Unconference coordinator, help folks sign up to host a session, maintain an updated schedule, direct individuals and groups to their tables, and keep tables looking neat.

### Catering

- Set up catering, replenish beverages and snacks, and notify venue staff of coffee refills and cleaning needs.

### Venue Load Out

- What's more fun than setting things up? Taking them down! Load out conference set up and leave the conference hall better than we found it.

## Will travel assistance be provided?
