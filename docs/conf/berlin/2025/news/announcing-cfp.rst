Announcing the Call for Proposals and Sponsorship Prospectus
============================================================

We're excited to announce both our `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`_ and the `sponsorship prospectus <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/sponsors/prospectus/>`_ for the {{city}} {{year}} conference.

Read on for more details about getting involved this year.

Call for Proposals
------------------

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our inspiring community of documentarians.

We're all looking forward to seeing you on stage in-person in Europe again. But that's not all, this year we're also opening up a few talk slots for pre-recorded videos for remote speakers, so if you can't make it to Berlin on {{ date.short }} you can still submit your proposal.

You can read our full `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`__, and `submit your talk <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`__ on the website.

The Call for Proposals will be open until **11:59 PM {{cfp.ends}} CEST**.

Sponsorship Updates
-------------------

Our `sponsorship prospectus <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/sponsors/prospectus/>`_ is updated for {{ year }},
with improvements based on sponsor feedback.

Tickets
-------

Tickets will go on sale in {{ date.tickets_live }}.

We are continuing our work on conference accessibility, and after the success of the recent Portland hybrid conference, making this event a hybrid one also, with virtual tickets, which include:

- Livestreaming for all talks and Q&A sessions on the main stage
- The ability to submit live Q&A questions for speakers
- Virtual hallway track and chat so you can network with other remote attendees

Head to our `Tickets page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/tickets/>`_ to get your virtual ticket.

In-person `ticket options <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/tickets/>`_ are:

* **Student or Unemployed Tickets**: *{{tickets.student.price}}*
* **Independent Tickets**: *{{tickets.independent.price}}*
* **Corporate Tickets**: *{{tickets.corporate.price}}*

As always, we try to keep ticket prices low so that the event is accessible to the widest range of people.
If you can't afford the tickets and still wish to attend, we will launch our grants program soon after opening ticket sales.
