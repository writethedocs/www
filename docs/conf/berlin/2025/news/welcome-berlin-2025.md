## Monday Unconference Sessions Open

We're opening up the Monday Unconference sign-ups today! We're doing this because Unconferences are amazing ways to foster connection within our community, and we hope this gives more visibility to the earlier Monday slots. [Learn more about the Unconference here](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/unconference/).

For those who are new to Unconferences or nervous about what makes a "good" topic, we have a vast range of topics and vibes every year. If you need some inspiration, consider any of these:

- Have a tricky situation or question burning in you? Whether that's about language, technology, workplace dynamics, job hunting, etc., there's definitely others with the same issues in mind.
- Made something recently you'd love to share? Whether that's requesting critique or offering a tool to help your fellow documentarians, we welcome you to bring your laptop and offer a demo.
- Focused on building community? Some attendees put on recurring  sessions for LGBTQ+ groups, for neurodiverse groups, for job hunters, for folks in particular geographic regions, etc. If you've got a drive to set something up, we welcome that! 

And as always, sign-ups are welcome during the conference. 

## Monday Lightning Talk Submissions Open

We're also opening up Monday Lightning Talk submissions. Lightning Talks are a wonderful way to share an idea, concept, or piece of information you find interesting, in an informal five-minute talk. Similar to above, we hope that by opening up Lightning Talks early, this provides more time to ideate and to submit your talk before the conference. [Learn more about giving a Lightning Talk here.](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/lightning-talks/)
