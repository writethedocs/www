# {{name}} {{year}} Recap - Talk Videos, Photos, CoC Report

Hi everyone,

Our team is slowly emerging from the post-conference recovery period, and we wanted to send out a quick message to thank everyone for helping to make Write the Docs {{name}} 2025 such a success. We appreciate everyone who makes the conference possible: speakers, sponsors, organizers, volunteers, and attendees alike!

It was amazing to see many of you again, both in Berlin and online!

## Conference recap

It has been a long time since we organised an in-person European conference, and we weren't quite sure how it was going to work out.
But, with **215 in-person attendees** and **120 virtual attendees**, it was a great success. We had the usual mix of talks on the main stage along with Q&A, Lightning Talks, Unconference sessions, and a social event.

We will continue to work on improving the conference experience for everyone, and we're exploring the option of a larger in-person venue, bringing back Writing Day, and some ideas for virtual enhancements. We appreciate all the feedback we've received already. If you have not provided feedback yet, please do.

## Talk videos

**Talk videos are available now.** This includes [all conference talks with Q&A, as well as the lightning talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZAeFn6dfHpkP1wAM5OIqAMH4guScopET).

Thanks again to all our presenters, emcees, and folks who asked wonderful questions!

## Conference photos

## T-shirts Are Available

The [Write the Docs {{city}} {{year}} T-shirt Shop]({{shirts.url}}) is still open! We have loose and fitted options from different fabrics, and you can choose exactly the size and cut you want. As in previous years, we're doing a mail order shop so people can order the exact shirt they want, if they want one.

The campaign will run in batches until {{shirts.ends}}. Shipping is available from the USA or Europe.

## Code of Conduct transparency report

As with any Write the Docs event, this conference was covered by our [community Code of Conduct](https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/). We aim to be as transparent with CoC incidents and enforcement as we can.

To ensure that our CoC was visible and accessible, we took a number of specific steps:

- Every participant agreed to the Code of Conduct in advance during registration.
- The CoC, or a summary, was included on the conference website and around the venue.
- The CoC was repeatedly mentioned in our conference introduction and announcements.
- We specifically stressed that the CoC applies to all conference spaces, including the social event.
- We encouraged all attendees to report any incident, even if they were not sure whether it was a violation.

There were no Code of Conduct issues reported for this conference.

Attendees can always report incidents, even after the conference, by emailing us at [conduct@writethedocs.org](mailto:conduct@writethedocs.org).

## Come to our upcoming events

Our next conference is [Portland 2026](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2026/) on May 3-5, 2026 **Portland, Oregon, USA**.
There may also be a [Write the Docs Meetup](https://www.writethedocs.org/meetups/) in your area. View the list to stay connected with the community.

## Thanks again

The conference is possible only because folks like you make it a great experience. Thanks for making it another wonderful year. Whether you were able to come out this time or not, we hope to see you again next year—or even sooner at one of our other events!
