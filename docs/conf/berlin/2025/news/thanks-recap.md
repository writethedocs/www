# Berlin 2025 Recap - Talk Videos, Photos, CoC Report

Hi everyone,

Our team is slowly emerging from the post-conference recovery period, and we wanted to send out a quick message to thank everyone for helping to make Write the Docs {{name}} 2025 such a success. We appreciate everyone who makes the conference possible: speakers, sponsors, organizers, volunteers, and attendees alike!

It was amazing to see many of you again in Berlin and online!

## Conference recap

It has been a long time since we organised an in-person European conference, and we weren't quite sure how it was going to work out.
But, with **220 in-person attendees** and **120 virtual attendees**, it was a great success. We had the usual mix of talks on the main stage along with Q&A, lightning talks, Unconference sessions, a social event.

We will continue to work on improving the conference experience for everyone, and we're exploring the option of a larger in-person venue, and bringing back Writing Day. We appreciate all the feedback we've received already.

## Talk videos

**Talk videos are available now.** This includes all conference talks with Q&A, as well as the lightning talks. Our [Berlin 2025 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=) has all the videos.

Thanks again to all our presenters, emcees, and folks who asked wonderful questions!

## Conference photos

The conference photos are almost all uploaded and edited. Our [2025 Berlin Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/writethedocs/albums//) has over 100 photos, thanks to our wonderful photographer [Kay](https://www.instagram.com/goatladykay/)! 

We really love the photos each year, and you're welcome to use them for non-commercial purposes, such as conference write-ups, as per our [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/).

## Code of Conduct transparency report

As with any Write the Docs event, this conference was covered by our [community Code of Conduct](https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/). We aim to be as transparent with CoC incidents and enforcement as we can.

To ensure that our CoC was visible and accessible, we took a number of specific steps:

- Every participant agreed to the Code of Conduct in advance during registration.
- The CoC, or a summary, was included on the conference website and around the venue.
- The CoC was repeatedly mentioned in our conference introduction and announcements.
- We specifically stressed that the CoC applies to all conference spaces, including the social event.
- We encouraged all attendees to report any incident, even if they were not sure whether it was a violation.

TODO ACTUAL REPORT

Attendees can always report incidents, even after the conference, by emailing us at [conduct@writethedocs.org](mailto:conduct@writethedocs.org).

## Come to our upcoming events

Our next conference is [Portland 2026](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2026/) on May 3-5, 2026 **Portland, Oregon**.
And, there may be a [Write the Docs Meetup](https://www.writethedocs.org/meetups/) near you.

## Thanks again

The conference is possible only because folks like you make it a great experience. Thanks for making it another wonderful year. Whether you were able to come out this time or not, we hope to see you again next yearâ€”or even sooner at one of our other events!
