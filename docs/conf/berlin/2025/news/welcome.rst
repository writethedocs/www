Announcing Write the Docs {{ city }} {{year}}
===========================================

We're excited to announce a new conference: Write the Docs Berlin!
This is a hybrid conference, with an in-person event in Berlin, Germany,
and a virtual platform.

**Write the Docs {{ city }} {{ year }} will be on {{ date.short }}**

Our in-person event will have two days of talks, a social event, and an unconference.
On the virtual platform, you can follow all talks, participate in the Q&A after,
and chat with your fellow attendees.

This will be our first in-person event in Europe since Prague 2019,
and we're excited to add this to our conference lineup once again.

Call for Proposals
------------------

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
**We plan to launch our CFP later this year**,
and now is a great time to start thinking about topics to present!

You can always look at our `previous talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/atlantic/{{ year - 1 }}/speakers/>`_ for inspiration.

Tickets
-------

Tickets will go on sale in {{ date.tickets_live }}.
We are keeping this edition a bit smaller than other conferences,
and will sell up to ~150 in-person tickets.
Virtual tickets will not be limited.

Sponsorship
-----------

We are working to revamp our sponsorship program for this year based on feedback from last year.
We will be announcing our new sponsorship levels soon,
but if you are already excited about sponsoring, reach out to us at sponsorship@writethedocs.org.

We're always open to customization or new ideas for our sponsorships.
