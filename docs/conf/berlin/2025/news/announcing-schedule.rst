Announcing Our Conference Schedule
===================================

The {{city}} conference is just under six weeks away, and we're busy getting ready behind the scenes.

You've already seen our list of awesome speakers; now we're announcing our :doc:`full conference schedule </conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/schedule/>` so you know when they will be presenting!

Speaker Schedule
----------------

The website is updated with the :doc:`schedule </conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/schedule/>` for the full conference, including main stage speaker talks, so you can start planning your time (and getting excited!) for the conference.

We'll continue to have a moderated Q&A session after each speaker. You'll have a chance to ask our speakers questions after the talk via our wonderful set of moderators. Virtual attendees can ask questions using the same link as folks attending locally.

Buy your tickets soon
---------------------

If you haven't gotten your ticket yet, buy it soon.
We expect the in-person tickets to sell out in the next few weeks.
Please ensure to arrange your travel only after buying a conference ticket.

If you need additional information, we have a few resources to help you:

* Visit our `Convince Your Manager page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/convince-your-manager/>`_ for assistance in making the case for attendance.
* Purchase your tickets on our `Tickets page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_.
* Plan your journey with our `Visiting {{city}} page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/visiting/>`_.

Interested in listening to the Speaker Talks in real time but unable to attend in person? Get a Virtual Ticket instead. View more about :doc:`attending virtually here </conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/virtual/>`. All in-person tickets also receive access to watch virtually as well. We do not expect Virtual Tickets to sell out.

T-shirts Are Available
----------------------

The `Write the Docs {{city}} {{year}} T-shirt Shop <{{shirts.url}}>`_ is still open! We have loose and fitted options from different fabrics, and you can choose exactly the size and cut you want. As in previous years, we're doing a mail order shop so people can order the exact shirt they want, if they want one.

The campaign will run in batches until {{shirts.ends}}. Shipping is available from the USA or Europe. We recommend you order your shirt at least 2-3 weeks in advance if you want to sport your fancy new garb during the conference.
