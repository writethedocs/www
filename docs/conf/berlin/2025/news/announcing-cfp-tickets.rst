Call for Proposals
------------------

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our inspiring community of documentarians.

We're all looking forward to seeing you on stage in-person in Europe again.
But that's not all, this year we're also opening up a few talk slots for pre-recorded videos for remote speakers, so if you can't make it to {{city}} on {{ date.short }} you can still submit your proposal.

You can read our full `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`__, and `submit your talk <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`__ on the website.

The Call for Proposals will be open until **11:59 PM {{cfp.ends}} CEST**.

Sponsorship Updates
-------------------

Our `sponsorship prospectus <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/sponsors/prospectus/>`_ is updated for {{ year }},
with improvements based on sponsor feedback, and updated for this new Berlin conference.

Grant Program
-------------
As always, we try to keep ticket prices low so that the event is accessible to the widest range of people.
However, if the cost or our tickets or travel expenses are an issue for you, you can apply to our Opportunity Grant program.

As a hybrid event, you can choose whether you want to attend in-person or virtually.
New this year is that we are limiting reimbursements to â‚¬ 500 per person (not including conference ticket cost),
to allow us to support more people.

You can apply until **{{ grants.ends }}** on `our website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/opportunity-grants/>`_.
