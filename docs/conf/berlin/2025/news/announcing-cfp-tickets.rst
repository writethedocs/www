Call for Proposals
------------------

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our inspiring community of documentarians.

We're all looking forward to seeing you on stage in-person in Europe again.
But that's not all, this year we're also opening up a few talk slots for pre-recorded videos for remote speakers, so if you can't make it to {{city}} on {{ date.short }} you can still submit your proposal.

You can read our full `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`__, and `submit your talk <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`__ on the website.

The Call for Proposals will be open until **11:59 PM {{cfp.ends}} CEST**.

Sponsorship Updates
-------------------

Our `sponsorship prospectus <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/sponsors/prospectus/>`_ is updated for {{ year }},
with improvements based on sponsor feedback, and updated for this new Berlin conference.

Tickets

Tickets are on sale!

We are continuing our work on conference accessibility, and after the success of the recent Portland hybrid conference, making this event a hybrid one also, with virtual tickets, which include:

- Live streaming for all talks and Q&A sessions on the main stage
- The ability to submit live Q&A questions for speakers
- Virtual hallway track and chat so you can network with other remote attendees

Head to our `Tickets page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/tickets/>`_ to get your ticket.

Grant Program
-------------
As always, we try to keep ticket prices low so that the event is accessible to the widest range of people.
However, if the cost or our tickets or travel expenses are an issue for you, you can apply to our Opportunity Grant program.

As a hybrid event, you can choose whether you want to attend in-person or virtually.
New this year is that we are limiting reimbursements to € 500 per person (not including conference ticket cost),
to allow us to support more people.

You can apply until **{{ grants.ends }}** on `our website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/opportunity-grants/>`_.
