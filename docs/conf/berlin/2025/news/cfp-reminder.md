# Reminder for Call for Proposals, Tickets, and Opportunity Grants

We hope you are looking forward to our Berlin conference as much as we are!

Today is mostly a reminder that we're accepting Talk Proposals until **{{ cfp.ends }}**.

Opportunity Grants are still open as well. And of course, tickets are on sale!

## Submit your talk by {{ cfp.ends }}

You still have just under three weeks to submit your talk to the conference. Check out the [Call for Proposals page](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp) for more details about what would make a great talk.

If you already have an idea but are having a difficult time getting your proposal together, you can always ask for talk feedback on the [Write the Docs Slack](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/). The community is here to help!

- Talk proposals are due by {{ cfp.ends }}.
- Everyone who submits will receive a response by {{ cfp.notification }}.

## Buy your ticket for the conference

The {{ name }} conference is {{ date.short }}. If you're excited to join us, go ahead and buy your ticket today! The [Tickets page](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/) has all the information about pricing and what is included.

This in-person event does have a limited capacity, so do not wait until the last moment to get your ticket,
as we may sell out some time before the conference.

Similar to our past conferences, we'll have great programming and social activities, including:

- Speaker Presentations
- Unconference Sessions
- Sponsor Expo
- Monday Night Social
- Lightning Talks

### Opportunity Grants are still open

Interested in attending but need extra financial support?
We strive to provide an accessible conference for folks of all backgrounds to join. Our opportunity grant application is open until **{{ grants.ends }}**.

View our [Opportunity Grants page](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/opportunity-grants/) for information and the grant application.

## Join our Community of Sponsors

Each year, we are grateful for the support of like-minded organizations that share our belief in a collaborative and welcoming community spirit, helping to make the conference a success.
