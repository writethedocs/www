Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our inspiring community of documentarians.
If there is something you’d really like to see a talk on this year, submit a proposal on it, or refer someone else who would be good!

Call for Proposals

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

You can read our full `Call for Proposals <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/vilnius/2019/cfp/>`__ on the website.

Tickets

Tickets are `on sale now <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/vilnius/2019/tickets/>`_!
As with our other conferences, we have tiered pricing to make it fair for everyone. Please buy the ticket that best fits your situation.

As always, we keep ticket prices low so that it is accessible to the widest range of people possible. However, if you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend, please email us at vilnius@writethedocs.org, and we can see how we can help.

For this first-year event we have a limited capacity of 50 documentarians, and we do expect to reach full capacity.
