## Giving a Presentation at Write the Docs

Are you planning to speak at Write the Docs? Great! Here's a few things that may
help you plan your presentation and the slides for your presentation.

### Facts

* Your talk will be 30 minutes
* There will be no time for questions
* Practice your talk, hopefully in front of at least 1 other person

### Presentation

This year, we will not be allowing time after the presentations for questions,
we feel posing questions for the speaker is best done on a more limited basis.
If any attendees have questions, they will be instructed to come up to stage to
present them to the speaker, rather than take up the time of the rest of the
audience.

Make sure when you practice your presentation, you are not counting on extra
time at the end for questions. You should plan on speaking for the full
30 minutes of your speaking slot. Don't worry if you run a little short on time
however, we are happy to provide attendees with extra time during talk breaks.

Make sure to practice your talk ahead of the conference.
If you haven't spoken before, your time will likely run
a bit shorter on stage than when you are practicing. Matt Haughey
wrote a [guide on giving a presentation][introverts-guide] that might be a
tremendous help to you if you are new to presenting in front of audiences.

There are a lot of different ways of thinking through making your slides.
Idan Gazit,
a previous speaker,
has written up a [great post](http://gazit.me/2012/12/05/designing-presentations.html) on how his process works.
Yours might not be the same,
but it might be useful to think through.

### Slides


You'll be responsible for making sure your laptop, or other display device, is
ready for your presentation. Be familiar with setting up an external display on
your machine, each presenter will have several minutes for set up before the
talk starts. We will provide connectors for Mac & HDMI.

Here are a few other tidbits to remember:

* Make sure that your slides are **high contrast**. It will make them easier for everyone to read in the room.
* Include your Twitter handle on your slides, so people can quote you properly :)
* Slides should be 16:9 resolution
* Have a PDF backup of your slides, just in case :)

Christina Elmore gave a great talk that is relevant to many of us at our 2014 conference.
Resist your urge to document with your presentation,
you are here for the room.
We highly recommend watching the full talk:
