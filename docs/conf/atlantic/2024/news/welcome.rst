Announcing Write the Docs {{ city }} {{year}}
===========================================

Welcome to the official launch of `Write the Docs {{ city }} {{year}} <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/>`_.
We're excited to announce the dates for our next conference: **Write the Docs {{ city }} {{ year }} will be held on** {{ date.main }}.

Following the success of last year's Atlantic conference, we will be running a **virtual event** again,
with a similar schedule.

The schedule will run from the
early afternoon to early evening in most European/African timezones,
and from early morning to late afternoon in US East Coast/South America timezones.
Of course, this being a virtual conference, attendees and speakers
are welcomed from anywhere in the world.

Sign up to the separate
`Atlantic conference mailing list <https://www.writethedocs.org/newsletter/>`_ to stay
up to date on the call for proposals, ticket sales and all other updates.


Call for Proposals
------------------

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

**We'll be launching the Call for Proposals early March 2024**, but if you're excited about speaking you can get thinking about your talk topic already.
We'll be asking speakers to upload a pre-recorded video of their talks, like last year, so you can present from anywhere!

Start thinking about your talk proposal now, and we'll let you know via the usual channels as soon as the CFP opens.


Tickets
-------

**Tickets will go on sale in {{ date.tickets_live }}**.
We will announce ticket prices soon, so that you can start planning your budget. However, we expect the prices to be similar to previous years. 

As always, we keep ticket prices low so that it is accessible to the widest range of people possible.
However, if you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend, we will be running our Opportunity Grants program again this year.

Sponsorship
