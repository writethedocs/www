Announcing Full Schedule
========================

Hey everyone!

We're around two months away from the next virtual {{city}} conference, and we're working hard to make sure it'll be as welcoming and fun as previous years.

Today we're announcing the full presentation schedule.

Conference platform
--------------------

This year, the conference will be held on a new platform, Venueless, so some things will look a little different.
But you'll find the usual spaces and experiences anyhow, including a stage for our amazing speakers,
integrated chat, unconference rooms with breakout calls, and expo booths.

Our updated Welcome Wagon guide, available soon, will help it feel familiar before you've even arrived.

All ticket holders will receive an invite to Venueless around one week before the conference.
If you don't have your ticket yet, `register one soon <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_, as we may sell out.

Full presentation schedule
--------------------------

The conference website is now updated with the :doc:`/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/schedule/` for the main stage presentations, so you can start planning your time (and getting excited!) for the conference.
We'll continue to hold live Q&A sessions after most talks. The Q&A will come from your questions but be moderated by our MCs.

As our attendees are in various time zones, we've planned a number of equal breaks throughout the day. We are all trying to balance our screen time, so we wanted to make sure that your eyes get their rest!

Instead of a separate social event, we've added time in the schedule before the start and after the end of each day, for you to socialize in the hallway sessions or one on one.

**All talk videos will be published on our YouTube channel no later than 1 week after the conference.**

Start thinking about Writing Day
--------------------------------

Our pre-conference `Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/writing-day/>`_ will happen on Sunday, and it is much more fun when folks come with their own projects in mind!

If you have a project or are part of a community that you think would benefit from a writing sprint, start brainstorming now about what you might want to focus on.
If you'd like us to include your project on the Writing Day page, `submit your project <https://forms.gle/j44pUr31RNyzy5pL6>`_ and we'll
add it to our `Writing Day project list <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/atlantic/{{year}}/writing-day/#your-project-here>`__.
You can also just show up on Sunday ready to introduce your project, but getting it on the website in advance can increase interest.


Shirts still on sale
--------------------

The `Write the Docs {{city}} {{year}} Pop-Up Shop <https://shirt.writethedocs.org/>`_ is open! We have loose and fitted options from different fabrics, and you can choose exactly the size and cut you want.

The campaign will run in batches until October 31st. Shipping is available from the USA or Europe. However, due to the global shipping situation, we recommend you order your shirt at least 2-3 weeks in advance if you want to sport your new threads during the conference.

All our events and activities
-----------------------------

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Every year we make sure to have a variety of activities that our attendees can enjoy, whether you want to learn something, meet new people, or share knowledge. We've done so for over a decade, and are holding to that plan in our virtual events.

* **Lightning Talks.** We'll have `lightning talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/lightning-talks/>`__ each day after lunch. These are 5-minute presentations and a lot of fun. They can be about anything you want; this is your chance to share something you are passionate about with the audience. Slides are not required.
* **Unconference.** We'll be running the `Unconference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/unconference/>`_ all day Monday and on Tuesday afternoon. Want to chat with like-minded folks about a specific thing? This is the place.
* **Conference Help Desk**. If you have any questions about navigating the virtual event, we'll be running the Write the Docs Helpdesk booth, where you can chat with one of the organizers and the Welcome Wagon team.

The `Schedule page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/schedule/>`_ has the latest and most complete information about all our events. This is where we will also update any changes/cancellations if they should occur.

Thanks to our sponsors
----------------------

Thanks in particular to our sponsors for supporting the conference this year.
We've excited to have them at our Sponsor Expo and around the entire conference participating in a few different ways.
