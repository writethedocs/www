Let's meet the Writing Day projects!
====================================

Welcome to the pre-conference, Writing Day project sneak peak. Let's get pumped for Writing Day!

Didn't get the chance to submit your project early? Fear not, you can submit it at any time between now and September 20 or you can bring it and submit it live during Writing Day. Day of project submissions are a time honored WTD tradition that we look forward to seeing continue.

Get excited, get delighted, and get ready to meet our Writing Day projects for Write the Docs Atlantic 2024.

Mutual Aid for Tech Writer/Documentarian Job Hunters
-----------------------------------------------------

We are delighted to once again welcome the Mutual Aid for Dcoumentarians projects, lead by the fantastic Kenzie Woodbridge (they/them). Kenzie has hosted this Writing Day session at multiple Write the Docs conferences and we are absolutely thrilled with their continued effort and support for the Write the Docs community.

WTD Meetup resources for organizers
------------------------------------

Writing Day co-organizer, Rose Williams (she/her), is thankful to have a co-organizer for the Atlantic 2024 event. This inspired her to submit a half-day session focused on updating and consolidating resources for WTD Meetup organizers.

Audinux - Plan and Publish a User Guide
---------------------------------------

We are delighted to welcome Hank Lee and Audimux to their first Writing Day! Audinux is repository for FOSS music applications and pluginss. As a project, they want to empower creative people and help them use Audinux to its full potential! To do that, they need documentarians to help create a user guide.

And more projects incoming!
---------------------------

We have two other projects incoming! We are currently working with their organizers to get them added to the Writing Day page. They'll be added to the Project List as soon as they are ready. 

Remember! Writing Day traditionally has projects that opt to join and announce themself that day. These projects are exclusively posted in the event.
