Let's meet the Writing Day projects!
====================================

Welcome to the pre-conference, Writing Day project sneak peak. Let's get pumped for Writing Day!

Didn't get the chance to submit your project early? Fear not, you can submit it at any time between now and September 20, or you can bring it and submit it live during Writing Day. Day-of project submissions are a time-honored WTD tradition that we enjoy seeing, year after year.

Reminder: Writing Day is included in our conference tickets. Sales close Thursday, September 19, at 23:59 UTC, so `get your tickets soon <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_.

Drumroll: get excited, get delighted, and get ready to meet our Writing Day projects for Write the Docs Atlantic 2024!

Mutual Aid for Tech Writer/Documentarian Job Hunters
-----------------------------------------------------

We are delighted to once again welcome the Mutual Aid for Documentarians projects, lead by the fantastic Kenzie Woodbridge (they/them). Kenzie has hosted this Writing Day session at multiple Write the Docs conferences and we are absolutely thrilled with their continued effort and support for the Write the Docs community.

WTD Meetup resources for organizers
------------------------------------

Writing Day co-organizer, Rose Williams (she/her), is thankful to have a co-organizer for the Atlantic 2024 event. This inspired her to submit a half-day session focused on updating and consolidating resources for WTD Meetup organizers.

Audinux - Plan and Publish a User Guide
---------------------------------------

We are delighted to welcome Hank Lee and Audinux to their first Writing Day! Audinux is a repository for FOSS music applications and pluginss. As a project, they want to empower creative people and help them use Audinux to its full potential! To do that, they need documentarians to help create a user guide.

Improve Open Source Docs with EkLine
------------------------------------

Give Puneet Arora a warm welcome for his third Writing Day and first virtual Atlantic Writing Day! He's here to offer free EkLine open-core licenses for OSS projects. Puneet will be available to help folks onboard EkLine on their OSS projects and show them how to use it to improve their documentation.

And more projects incoming!
---------------------------

We have other projects incoming! We are currently working with their organizers to get them added to the Writing Day page. They'll be added to the Project List as soon as they are ready. 

Remember! Writing Day traditionally has projects that opt to join and announce themselves that day. These projects are posted exclusively inside the event space.
