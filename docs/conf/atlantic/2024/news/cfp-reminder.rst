Call for Proposals Reminder
===========================

Greetings, documentarians! Just a reminder that the `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`_ will close at **Midnight {{tz}} on {{cfp.ends}}.**

If there is something you’d really like to see a talk about this year, submit a proposal for it or refer someone else who would be good!
And if you already have an idea but you’re having a hard time getting your proposal to come together, you can always ask for feedback on the `Write the Docs Slack <https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`_. The community is there to help!
Our CFP page also has helpful tips on how to write a proposal.

We’ll then be reviewing all the talk proposals, and will be contacting everyone who submitted a proposal by **{{ cfp.notification }}**.

Get your ticket for the conference
-----------------------------------

**The Atlantic conference will be held online on {{ date.short }}.** The `full event website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/>`_ is live, with some preliminary details, and we'll be filling in more as it gets closer.

Tickets are already on sale, so go ahead and `register for your ticket now <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_!

Grant program
-------------

If the cost of our tickets is prohibitive to you, you can apply to our Opportunity Grant program.
As a virtual event, we're excited to be able to offer free tickets to a larger number of people, since there are now minimal other costs to attend the event.

You can apply until **{{ grants.ends }}** on `our website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/opportunity-grants/>`_.

Support our community by sponsoring
-----------------------------------

Every year we are fortunate to have the support of like-minded organizations and communities, who believe in the collaborative and welcoming community spirit and help us make our events great.

We have published our `virtual conference sponsorship prospectus`_ for the conference,
and are open for new sponsorship inquiries.

Looking forward to seeing you all in our virtual space!
