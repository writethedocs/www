Run of Show
===========

{% else %}

This Run of Show provides more context about the event and answers some common questions you may have.
Please let us know if there is any information missing that would be useful for you.

Sponsorship schedule
--------------------

* **SUNDAY**: The conference online platform is open. You are welcome to hang out at your sponsorship booth and attend the Writing Day, but no formal sponsorship events are happening. You're also encouraged to lead a Writing Day project if your documentation is open source.

* **MONDAY**: The conference platform is open all day, so we recommend arriving around the time it opens to get the most interaction with attendees. 

* **TUESDAY**: The Sponsor Expo will be on Tuesday in the first 3 hours, in the Expo area of the online platform. It will take place in existing sponsorship booths. If you do not have a booth, a temporary booth will be set up for the sponsor expo, and then removed after.

See the :doc:`full schedule </conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/schedule>` for exact timing details.

Sponsorship platform
--------------------

We will be using `Hopin <https://hopin.to/>`_ as our online conference platform. It has multiple unique spaces for attendees during the conference, and we hope it will allow for a good amount of interaction between attendees and sponsors. The conference platform won't become fully active until the Sunday of the conference.

Sponsorship spaces
------------------

A quick overview of the important spaces in the "venue":

* The *Main stage* is where the talks happen. This is also where Lightning talks will be given.
* The *Sessions area* is where the Writing Day and Unconference will happen.
* The *Expo area* is where the Sponsor Expo will happen. You can chat in text or video directly with attendees.

Sponsorship events
------------------

Sponsor Expo
~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Tuesday, for the first 3 hours, we hold our Sponsor Expo,
which is a wonderful place to connect with our attendees.
This gives you a chance to discuss whatever you'd like to with our attendees.

Many attendees are looking for jobs now or will be in the near future,
so it's a great chance to talk more about your company culture and open positions.
Similarly,
they are always looking for great products to use in their day to day workflows.

**Logistics**: You will be assigned a sponsor booth in the *Expo area* where you can engage with attendees and answer questions.  We recommend that you answer general questions in the main session and then break off into private calls or chats to talk in more depth with specific people.

You can also offer attendees a link to your website or a way to register interest in your job postings.

Writing day
~~~~~~~~~~~

On Sunday we hold our Writing Day.
This is a place where the community gathers to get actual work done.
This generally involved communities and organizations hosting a documentation sprint on some piece of documentation that is open source and needs improvements.

If you want to participate in the Writing Day,
it helps to do a bit of work up front.
The best way to prepare is to have a set of issues that you've already picked as "easy for beginners".
Starting with these issues will make it much easier for people to start,
and feel productive.
Make sure you also have good installation instructions and other helpful beginners content as well.

**Logistics**: We will send a signup sheet to the general attendee list a week before the conference, where you can sign up. You can introduce your project to attendees on Sunday during the Writing Day Introduction.

How do I get the most out of my sponsorship?
--------------------------------------------

Come prepared to engage with our community, and to learn just as much as you teach. Engage with our event as attendees as well as sponsors. Send technical staff who can chat with people on the interesting things your company is doing, and get value from the vast amount of insight in the room. We do have some decision makers in the room, but soft sells will work better than hard sales in the environment we strive for.

Who is my primary contact?
--------------------------

Eric Holscher will be your primary contact, but our team is available at sponsorship@writethedocs.org. If you have a time sensitive inquiry, please email the entire team to ensure a timely response.

During the conference itself, we will also have a *help desk* available on the Hopin platform.
You can find staff members there to ask any additional questions you might have.

How do I use my sponsorship tickets?
------------------------------------

You should have received a unique URL with a discount code for your sponsorship tickets. We are happy to send it over again, just ask!

How do I use my job postings?
-----------------------------

You can post your jobs to our `job board <https://jobs.writethedocs.org/>`_.
You will be given a discount code that will let you post them for free,
please ask us for this if you don't have it!
They will be published in our :doc:`Newsletter </newsletter>` every month,
and displayed on our website as well.

What do I need for the sponsor expo?
------------------------------------

The Sponsor Expo will be a low key event.
Generally we recommend having links available to resources, and ways for attendees to engage with you online after the event.

What does the platform look and feel like?
------------------------------------------

You can see a demo of the platform in this video.
It's currently linked to the expo hall demo,
but it has demos of all the other areas as well:
