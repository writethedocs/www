The Good Docs Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`The Good Docs Project <https://thegooddocsproject.dev/>`_ is an open source community of 60+ technical writers, doc tools 
experts, UX designers, and software engineers who are committed to improving the quality 
of documentation in open source. We aim to educate and empower people to create 
high-quality documentation by providing them with templates, resources, best practices, 
and tools to enhance their documentation in open source and beyond.

Our project is divided into small working groups that consist of a few people collaborating 
together to work on a Good Docs Project initiative or focus area of the project. Throughout 
Writing Day, weâ€™ll feature workshops that will introduce you to our project and provide 
feedback on these key initiatives, such as our project to provide templates for a variety 
of documentation content.

Mutual aid for tech writer/documentarian job hunters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Note: Second session only*

Coordinated by Kenzie Woodbridge, they/them. Kenzie has hosted this session 
for previous virtual Write the Docs conferences during Writing Day.

Are you thinking of applying for a new or different tech writer/documentarian 
jobs and would appreciate feedback on your resume? Or, are you responsible for 
hiring and know what you're looking for in a resume and application? Let's get 
together and offer each other some feedback on the important documentation 
we're using to move our careers forward.

Let's help each other get ready for the job fair!

The Blog Writing Room
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Struggling to get into blogging? Our project, The Blog Writing Room, is designed to 
give technical writers and documentarians a space to come together to work on writing 
blog posts in a supportive and collaborative environment.

Our Writing Day goals:

- Connect with other technical writers and documentarians who want to blog 
- Harness the positive momentum of the community to get some blog posts written
- Challenge ourselves to not only write the darn post but share it with the world

You're welcome to join us any time throughout Writing Day. To make the most of our 
time together, we have planned two round table discussions and two writing workshops:

- Roundtable 1: "Blogging for non-bloggers"
- Blog writing workshop
- Writing Day snack break
- Roundtable 2: "Best practices for turning conversations into blog posts"
- Blog writing workshop

The workshops are a space for everyone to brainstorm and encourage each other to 
proverbially "put pen to paper." We can't wait to hear your ideas, tips, and tricks - 
no matter the topic. We're excited to see you share your knowledge with the Write the Docs 
community and beyond using blog posts!"
