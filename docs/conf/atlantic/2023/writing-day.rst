The Good Docs Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`The Good Docs Project <https://thegooddocsproject.dev/>`_ is an open source community of 60+ technical writers, doc tools 
experts, UX designers, and software engineers who are committed to improving the quality 
of documentation in open source. We aim to educate and empower people to create 
high-quality documentation by providing them with templates, resources, best practices, 
and tools to enhance their documentation in open source and beyond.

Our project is divided into small working groups that consist of a few people collaborating 
together to work on a Good Docs Project initiative or focus area of the project. Throughout 
Writing Day, weâ€™ll feature workshops that will introduce you to our project and provide 
feedback on these key initiatives, such as our project to provide templates for a variety 
of documentation content.

Mutual aid for tech writer/documentarian job hunters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Note: Second session only*

Coordinated by Kenzie Woodbridge, they/them. Kenzie has hosted this session 
for previous virtual Write the Docs conferences during Writing Day.

Are you thinking of applying for a new or different tech writer/documentarian 
jobs and would appreciate feedback on your resume? Or, are you responsible for 
hiring and know what you're looking for in a resume and application? Let's get 
together and offer each other some feedback on the important documentation 
we're using to move our careers forward.

Let's help each other get ready for the job fair!

The Blog Writing Room
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Struggling to get into blogging? Our project, The Blog Writing Room, is designed to 
give technical writers and documentarians a space to come together to work on writing 
blog posts in a supportive and collaborative environment.

Our Writing Day goals:

- Connect with other technical writers and documentarians who want to blog 
- Harness the positive momentum of the community to get some blog posts written
- Challenge ourselves to not only write the darn post but share it with the world

You're welcome to join us any time throughout Writing Day. To make the most of our 
time together, we have planned two round table discussions and two writing workshops:

- Roundtable 1: "Blogging for non-bloggers"
- Blog writing workshop
- Writing Day snack break
- Roundtable 2: "Best practices for turning conversations into blog posts"
- Blog writing workshop

The workshops are a space for everyone to brainstorm and encourage each other to 
proverbially "put pen to paper." We can't wait to hear your ideas, tips, and tricks - 
no matter the topic. We're excited to see you share your knowledge with the Write the Docs 

Code for the Carolinas - Codeberg Pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Code for the Carolinas <https://codeforthecarolinas.org/>`_ is a small, all-volunteer civic technology organization. 
We use `Codeberg Pages <https://docs.codeberg.org/codeberg-pages/>`_ to host our website, learn more
about `Codeberg <https://codeberg.org/>`_.

We want to empower other small volunteer organizations to use Codeberg Page, which is a free, 
open source software (FOSS) collaboration platform. We recognize that other volunteer 
organization in our industry may have a volunteers with a wide variety of backgrounds 
and technical experience. Our mission for Writing Day is to create a beginner-friendly 
version of the Codeberg Pages documentation to inspire these volunteers to create sustainable and
maintainable sites for their organizations.

To accomplish our mission we have created the following Writing Day goals:

- Develop inclusive documentation that welcomes volunteers with a variety of technical backgrounds
- Test the usability of our existing process `Wiki <https://codeberg.org/Code_for_the_Carolinas/pages/wiki/>`_  entries
- Document general processes for creating pull requests, adding new pages, and reviewing pull requests
- Create process documentation for our admin team to reviewing and merging pull requests

We hope to connect with some folks who can combine their technical writing skill with their 
knowledge of Codeberg, or similar tools for collaborative software development. We also 
believe that the process of creating this documentation is a valuable learning experience 
about questioning assumptions and understanding tools for website creation. We want to ensure
that we are setting up ourselves for success and creating sustainable documentation so we can
maintain our site and help others along the way.

Depending on timing and interest, there may be additional ooportunities to:

- Use code comments to document HTML and CSS features of our website
- Submit issues or pull requests to Codeberg for corrections to the official documentation

Brainstorm a Help Center Style Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Note: First session only*

As writers and documentarians, many of us have been tasked with creating style guides 
for the projefts and companies we worked for to standardize and support our documentation
efforts.

The Brainstorm a Style Guide project aspires to support writers and documentarians,
especially those new to the field, in creating their style guides.

Writing Day goal: Outline a help center style guide that empowers others and helps
them write help center articles with a consistent and unified voice. 

We have an `example style guide <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RzZ8XhB7S8aBmXuSsysZfZHPAb8AQu-5/edit>`_ to help get you started1

Join us and share your ideas, best practices, and guidelines for style guides! We want
to become a springboard for others attendees who are creating style guides for the OSS 
projects, brands, and the companies they represent.
