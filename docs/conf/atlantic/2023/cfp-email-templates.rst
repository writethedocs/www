   WTD {{city}} {{year}} -- talk accepted!

::

   Hi {name},

   The Write the Docs {{city}} talk selection committee has finished the review process and we'd love it if you could join us as a speaker!

   Write the Docs {{city}} is held **online {{date.short}}** in {{tz}}.

   We think your talk: '{proposal_title}' would be a great fit for the conference. We'd love to have you prepare it for a **30-minute** time slot.

   Please click this link to confirm your attendance:

   ○ {confirmation_link}

   Please **reply to this email as soon as possible** if you need to let us know either of the following

   ○ If you have a strong preference for presenting on Monday or Tuesday, or in the morning or afternoon due to timezones or other restrictions.
   ○ If you already purchased a ticket so we can issue you a refund.

   Okay, with all that out of the way, it's time for the fun part: preparing your talk! To make sure everybody's on the same page, here are a few important things to keep in mind:

   * Remember that one of the biggest strengths of the Write the Docs community is that we come from a huge variety of professional and personal backgrounds.
     When you're writing your talk (just like when you're writing documentation), think about the diverse needs and interests of your audience, avoid (or define) any jargon-y language, and make sure you clearly express what people are going to learn from your talk.
   * Remember this is a community conference. If you're representing your employer it's okay to mention that, but please don't treat your talk as a marketing opportunity.
   * If you would be interested in having another member of the Write the Docs community mentor you through the talk preparation process, please tell us! We'll do our best to connect you with someone to bounce ideas off, to review drafts, and to help you refine your talk before the conference.
   * Make sure you plan your talk to fit in the allotted time.
   * Please review our Code of Conduct (http://writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/) and make sure your talk content adheres to it. As a rule of thumb, if you're on the fence about whether something in your talk could be considered inappropriate or offensive, leave it out. If you have a question about the code, feel free to email us and ask!

   If you're concerned about expenses such as microphones or video cameras, let us know. We do have a budget for speaker expenses, but it can't cover all our speakers.
   As we confirm your details, we'll publish your abstract, headshot, and information on the conference site. We'll also be emailing attendees so they can share in our excitement about the talks we'll be presenting this year!

   Thanks again for submitting your talk, we look forward to seeing you up on the Write the Docs stage! As you share the good news, remember to tag your posts with #writethedocs. And in the meantime, feel free to email us with any questions, concerns, or ideas.

   Thanks for helping make this year's conference another great one!

   Hi {name},

   Thanks so much for submitting a proposal to speak at this year's Write the Docs {{city}}. Every year we receive a growing number of proposals, and we're always blown away by the amazing breadth of knowledge that our community brings to the table.  Unfortunately, presentation spots are limited and the talk selection committee wasn't able to include your talk in our program this year.

   During the review process, each member of the review committee considered each proposal carefully and then compared notes to make their final selections. We thought it might be useful to share a couple of the common themes for why talks may not have been included for this year's event:

   * We had too many good talks. The quality of our submissions gets higher every year, and we always end up having to pass up on some talks that we're really excited by.
   * The subject of the talk was too specific for a larger audience. One of the biggest strengths of the Write the Docs community is that we come from a huge variety of professional and personal backgrounds. The committee looks specifically for talks that appeal to a good mix of our attendees.
   * The subject of the talk was too broad and didn't have a strong enough connection to the core interests of the community.
   * The talk focused heavily on documentation tooling. We think these talks are important, but we tend to showcase higher-level concepts that progress the way we think in the documentation world.
   * There were multiple talks on the same topic. We try to choose talks that cover a wide range of topics, which means making some hard choices between multiple great talks on similar topics.

   Keep in mind that we do run several batches of lightning talks that you can sign up for at the event. We also have an unconference space which is a great chance for more informal discussions. We'd love to have you, your ideas, and your passion at the conference--on stage or not, they're what make this event great!

   Thanks again for your proposal. We strongly encourage you to submit again, for future events, and in the meantime we hope to see you in {{city}} or online!

   Hi {name},

   Thanks so much for submitting a proposal to speak at this year's Write the Docs {{city}} conference. Our selection committee has just wrapped up our review, and we had such a hard time choosing from so many awesome proposals. We'd like to ask if you'd be willing to be on the short list of alternate talks that we'd really like to see, but ran out of room for on the schedule.

   Basically, what this entails is bearing with us for another week or two, while we get confirmations from our other speakers. If we have a speaker turn us down, their slot is yours! We'll let you know, one way or the other, in the next couple of weeks, so you won't have be in suspense for too long. Please reply as soon as you can and let us know if you'd be willing to stick it out.

   Thanks again for your proposal, and either way, we hope to see you at the conference!

   WTD {{city}} {{year}} -- speaker logistics

::

   Hi {name},

   Just wanted to drop you all a quick note covering some logistics. Talks are pre-recorded again this year, we'd love to get those recordings from you before {{cfp.video_by}}. We do have a videographer who can help you record remotely, drop us a line if that is something you're interested in. We're finalizing details on the live Q&A for each talk.

   ○  I've added some questions to our [CFP tool (Pretalx)]({{cfp.url}}) about your pronouns, interesting facts, name pronunciation, and slack username. Please log in at {{cfp.url}} and answer those (although we'll only need them closer to the event).

   ○ If you haven't done so already, please upload a speaker pic to your Pretalx account while you're there, it'll look so much better than the anonymous outline.

   ○ Private speaker slack channel! If you're not on the slack already, [join the WTD slack]({{slack_join}}). Once you're signed up, or if you're already on there, ping me @plaindocs so I can add you to the private speaker channel. It contains all of our past speakers, who will be happy to offer advice or answer questions.

   ○ [Speaker mentoring guidelines](https://www.writethedocs.org/organizer-guide/confs/cfp/#speaker-mentoring) -- let us know if you'd like to talk over your proposal or slide deck with a speaker from a previous year.

   ○ While you're working on your talks, we'd love for you to check out our updated [speaking tips](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/speaking-tips/) page! It's got all sorts of details on talk format, tech specs, content guidelines, etc.

   Also, if you're ever in doubt about whether something you're writing would be appropriate or not, we'd like to refer you to our conference Code of Conduct, which asks that you refrain from any sexually suggestive or harassing language of any kind. Check it out in full, drop me a line if you have questions: http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/

   Looking forward to emailing with you all over the coming months.

   WTD {{city}} {{year}} -- talk recording

::

   Hi {name},

   Here are the important details you've been waiting for! I'll get into specifics below, but first the important ones:

   ○ We'd love you to upload your recorded talk by the **{{ cfp.video_by }}**, or soon after. If you're likely to need more time, please let me know in advance.
   ○ We have folks who can help you record online, both in US and EU time zones, if this is of interest just let me know and I'll get a slot booked. [Recording guidelines](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/talk-recording-guidelines/).
   ○ As well as the tips in the recording guidelines we've updated the [speaking tips](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/speaking-tips/) for virtual conferences.

   Now those essentials are covered, a little more info about the event itself:

   * We'll be using [Hopin](https://hopin.to/) for the event, over the coming weeks we'll get you account details so you can update head-shots and taglines on there.
   * We'll be live captioning as usual, and if you can get copies of your slides to make the captioners work easier that would be delightful. We need those a week or so before the event, so no rush.
   * In a change from our in person event, we'll be hosting moderated Q&A in a separate Hopin room, directly after each talk.

   Next week I'll send over a provisional schedule, and if having a particular slot would make it easier to attend the Q&A, let me know and I'll see what I can do.

   And while we're here, ;-) if you don't have a profile picture set in [Pretalx](https://pretalx.com/write-the-docs-{{shortcode}}-{{year}}/login/), now would be a great time to add one.

   And I think that is it! I'm excited to see this taking shape and excited to see all of your hard work on the virtual stage!

   Please get in touch if I can help with anything, if you have worries, thoughts or ideas.

   Hi {name},

   Hope you're all well!

   We're about five weeks out from the conference now, lots of stuff is happening behind the scenes, and I hope you're feeling good about recording.

   We've got a [provisional schedule]({{cfp.preview}}) up, and I'd *love it* if you could check your time-slot and make sure you can do a live Q&A shortly after your talk is streamed. I've tried to cater to all timezone requirements, but if you can't make your Q&A slot let me know and I'll refactor. We'll be publishing the schedule on **Monday**.

   We're trying something new this year, and doing one Q&A for two talks, so it'll be live call with the emcee, and two speakers (or more for talks with multiple speakers). A mini panel if you will. The exact format for each Q&A will be casual conversation style, the emcee passing moderated questions from the audience to one speaker or the other (or even both where applicable).

   A few folks asked where to upload talk recordings when you have them (by **{{cfp.video_by}}** right?):

   * [Talk recording upload]({{cfp_variables['upload']}})

   If you'd like help recording that, let me know and I'll book you a slot with our videographer Bart.

   You might find it useful to check out the [Recording guidelines](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/talk-recording-guidelines/) and [speaking tips](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/speaking-tips/) for virtual conferences.

   And while we're here, 😉 if you don't have a profile picture set in [Pretalx](https://pretalx.com/write-the-docs-portland-2022/login/), now would be a great time to add one, and to fill out the questions on pronouns, name pronuniation and interests for our emcee intro.

   As we've done for the past few years we'll be live captioning all talks, and it makes the [captioners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFnM6vmvWaI) lives *much* easier if you can send in a copy of your slides, or even a word list of unusual words that you might use. Please upload those to the [Talk recording drive]({{cfp_variables['upload']}}) by **{{cfp.slides_by}}**.

   In a few weeks I'll be in touch with some calendar invites for a sound check during the conference, to make sure you're all sorted with Hopin logins, audio and video, and to answer any questions you might have.

   And I think that is it! I'm excited to see this taking shape and excited to see all of your hard work on the virtual stage!

   Please get in touch if I can help with anything, if you have worries, thoughts or ideas.

   Hi {name},

   The conference is almost upon us! First off, thank you all so much for all of the hard work you've put into getting the recordings done and uploaded. Most of the hard work is behind you, and you can settle in and enjoy the conference 😊, but before you relax entirely, please:

   ○ confirm that you've [uploaded your slides or vocabulary](https://bartatwork.stack.storage/s/tITmETk0y4Zz2nv8) for the captioners, **and** [answered the questions]({proposal_url}) that the emcee uses to record your intro by May 15th.

   ○ register your free [Hopin speaker ticket]({{cfp_variables['ticket']}}) -- the entire conference is held in Hopin, from writing day on Sunday, all talks, unconference sessions, chat, etc. Only the Monday evening social will be held in Spatial.chat.

   ○ schedule an [audio-visual check]({{cfp_variables['calendly']}}) with me or our AV tech **the day before** your talk. This helps me know you're around 😉 and logged in to Hopin, and lets us clear up any audio or visual issues before your Q&A. We recommend you do this even if you're confident about your setup. The audio-visual checks happen in a private Hopin room.

   Remember, all Q&A sessions this year will be a joint chat with the emcee and two speakers, and **start straight after every other talk**, in the Speaker Q&A session (the Monday and Tuesday Q&A sessions have different URLs).

   Some speakers like to hang out in the event chat and answer questions during their talk, but that is entirely up to you. We'll be moderating questions before the Q&A regardless.

   If you have any questions at all about the event, you definitely know how to reach me by now.
