Announcing Call for Proposals
=============================

Today we are announcing our `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`_.

Speaking at Write the Docs Atlantic is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our inspiring global community of documentarians.
If there is something you’d really like to see a talk on, submit a proposal on it, or refer someone else who you think would be good!

Sign up to the `Atlantic conference mailing list <https://www.writethedocs.org/newsletter/>`_ to be the first to hear details as we announce them.

Call for Proposals
------------------
Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

**The conference is virtual and all talks will be pre-recorded, allowing you to present and attend from anywhere!**
Our video producer will be available to help with recording if you want it.
Timezones permitting, there will be a remote live Q&A with our moderators after every talk.

The schedule will run from the early afternoon to early evening in most European/African timezones,
and from early morning to late afternoon in US East Coast/South America timezones.
Of course, this being a virtual conference, attendees and speakers are welcomed from anywhere in the world.

Read the full `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`__, 
it will be open until **23:59 {{cfp.ends}} {{ tz }}**.

Tickets
-------
Tickets will go on sale in April.
Pricing will be similar to the `Prague 2022 virtual conference pricing <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2022/tickets/>`__.

As always, we keep ticket prices low so that the event is accessible to the widest range of people possible.
However, if you can't afford the tickets and still wish to attend, we will launch our grants program when we open ticket sales.
