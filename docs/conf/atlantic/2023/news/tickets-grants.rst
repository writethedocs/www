Announcing Ticket Sales and Grant Program
=========================================

Greetings, documentarians! Today we're happy to announce that tickets are `on sale now <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_ and our `Opportunity Grant program <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/opportunity-grants/>`_ is open.

Following the success of our previous virtual conferences, we look forward to our first Atlantic conference.
The Call for Papers has closed and we're currently reviewing all proposals. We're looking forward to announcing
our speakers soon.


Get your ticket for the conference
----------------------------------

**The {{shortcode}} conference will be held online on {{ date.short }}.** The `full event website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/>`_ is live, with most details, and we'll be filling in more as it gets closer.

Tickets are on sale now, so go ahead and `register for your ticket now <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_! Even though our capacity is more flexible due to the virtual event platform, we might still sell out to make sure we're providing a manageable event size for our attendees, as always.

We're going to keep the spirit of our previous virtual conferences for Prague and Portland:

* Excellent single track of pre-recorded presentations with live moderated Q&A
* Writing Day sessions
* Unconference sessions
* A virtual hallway track

We really want to make sure that folks can get value from being at the event at the same time, and we think it will be another great year of helping our community connect.


Grant program
-------------

We updated our grant program application to take into account the virtual format of the event.
We're excited to be able to offer free tickets to a larger number of people, since there are now minimal other costs to attend the event.

You can apply by **{{ grants.ends }}** on `our website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/opportunity-grants/>`_.


Support our community by sponsoring
-----------------------------------

Every year we are fortunate to have the support of like-minded organizations and communities, who believe in the collaborative and welcoming community spirit and help us make our events great.

We have published our `virtual sponsorship prospectus`_ for the conference,
and are open for new sponsorship inquiries.

.. _virtual sponsorship prospectus: https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/sponsors/prospectus/

We will still run the `job fair <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/job-fair/>`_, helping documentarians and organizations connect with each other. Check out the sponsorship prospectus for more details and to reserve your spot today.
