Conference highlights
===============================================

Hey everyone,

Our team is now emerging from the post-conference recovery period, and we wanted to send out a quick message to thank everyone for helping to make our conference such a success. 
We appreciate everyone who makes the conference possible: speakers, sponsors, organizers, volunteers, and attendees alike!

Conference recap
----------------

At **almost 300 attendees** this conference was a welcoming and friendly event.
This was our first Atlantic conference, where we intentionally created a schedule that suited attendees from Europe, Africa, US East Coast and parts of South America. In practice, we had attendees for all over the world, including the West coast of the United States and Asia. 

We had the usual mix of talks on the main stage, along with moderated Q&A, lightning talks, unconference sessions, writing sprints, and a sponsor expo, similar to previous virtual conferences.

Talk videos
-----------

`Videos of the talks`_ are now available on YouTube. This includes all conference talks and Q&A, as well as the lightning talks.
You can also subscribe to our `YouTube channel`_ so you don’t miss any talk videos from our conferences.

Thanks again to all our presenters, moderators, and folks who asked wonderful questions!
Huge thanks also to `Bart at Work`_ for handling the A/V production on our event, it was flawless once again this year.

Code of Conduct transparency report
-----------------------------------

As with any Write the Docs event, this conference was covered by our `community Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__.
We aim to be as transparent with CoC incidents and enforcement as we can.

To ensure that our CoC was visible and accessible, we took a number of specific steps:

- Every participant agreed to the Code of Conduct in advance during registration.
- The CoC, or a summary, was included on the conference website and Hopin Reception
- The CoC was repeatedly mentioned in our conference introduction and announcements.
- We specifically stressed that the CoC applies to all conference spaces including the social event.
- We encouraged all attendees to report any incident, even if they were not sure whether it was a violation.

None of our organizers were approached about any CoC concerns related to this event.
We know that this is, in part, a reflection of the thoughtful and inclusive community that we're so lucky to have.

That being said, we're also very conscious of the fact that just because nothing was reported doesn't mean nothing happened. 
If there was any personal conduct or other aspect of the conference experience that did not meet the expectations of behavior set out in the CoC, please email us at `conduct@writethedocs.org <mailto:conduct@writethedocs.org>`_.

Thanks again
