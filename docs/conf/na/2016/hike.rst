Write the Docs Hike
===================

One of the organizers, Eric Holscher, knows a ton about hiking in the
Portland area, and would love to show off a side of Portland visitors
don't often see.

Every year we have a conference hike, at this point it's a fantastic
tradition. We'll be doing the same hike again this year, because it's
the best one easily accessible from downtown Portland.

It's rained on us the past couple years, but I have faith it will be
beautiful this year! We shall see Mount Hood at the top :)

We will be hiking in the amazing `Forest
Park <http://www.forestparkconservancy.org/>`__, the largest urban
forested park in the country. It is conveniently located in Northwest
Portland, not far from the conference venue. It's about a 35 minute walk
from the venue to the park, or you can `take
transit <https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Crystal+Ballroom,+1332+W+Burnside+St,+Portland,+OR+97209,+United+States/MacLeay+Park+Entrance,+Northwest+Upshur+Street,+Portland,+OR/@45.5290603,-122.707244,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x54950a02e43decb9:0xe289ad93ad758c66!2m2!1d-122.68483!2d45.522785!1m5!1m1!1s0x549509e98d3dabd5:0xe1f0810cfb8e8ca8!2m2!1d-122.712528!2d45.535874!3e3?hl=en>`__
to make it a bit quicker.

**Note**

The hike does not end where it starts. Take this into consideration with
your planning. There is an out-and-back option if you choose to just go
to Pittock Mansion, then return back down.

What to bring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

May in Portland can be interesting. It will probably be in the 60s, with
a chance of rain. So, please bring:

-  Comfortable shoes, that you are comfortable getting a bit muddy.
-  1 Liter of water. There is water available halfway through the hike.
-  A light rain jacket. It won't be cold, but it might drizzle on you.
-  High spirits!

The hike
--------

The hike will be around 5 miles long, and have 1000 feet of elevation
gain. This classifies as a *moderate* hike. We'll be going nice and slow
so people can appreciate the views and forest.

Meander
~~~~~~~

It will follow Balch Creek up from the entrance of `Forest
Park <http://www.forestparkconservancy.org/>`__.

Climb
~~~~~

Then we will switchback through beautiful forest until we get to Pittock
Mansion. Pittock affords one of the best views of the city, and
hopefully Mt. Hood & Mt. St. Helens if it's clear!

Admire
~~~~~~

After this we will descend into `Washington
Park <http://washingtonparkpdx.org/>`__, and the beautiful `Hoyt
Arboretum <http://www.hoytarboretum.org/>`__. There are a number of
paths through Hoyt, and we can play that by ear. More than 5,800
specimens from around the world grow here, including more than 1,100
species, which are valuable in reforesting damaged habitats.

Finish
~~~~~~

On the other side of Hoyt is the `Oregon
Zoo <http://www.oregonzoo.org/>`__, where we can take the MAX back to
downtown. People who wish to stay around in the park or zoo are more
than welcome.
