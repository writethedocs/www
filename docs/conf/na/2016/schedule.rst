Schedule
========

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Each year we organize a wide
range of events so that people can come together, collaborate, and learn
from each other in different ways.

Saturday, May 21st
------------------

The only event scheduled on Saturday is the :doc:`annual hike to Pittock
Mansion </conf/na/2016/hike>`. If you get into town early, join us on
the hike and take the chance to explore Portland in all of its glory.

Sunday, May 22nd
----------------

During the day, we'll hold our :doc:`Writing Day documentation
sprints </conf/na/2016/writing-day>`, followed by the conference
reception in the evening.

We encourage everyone to drop by on Sunday evening for the conference
reception. You'll have a chance to get acquainted with each other over
some drinks and snacks. We'll also help groups organize dinner plans, so
you can continue your conversations over more substantial food as well.
