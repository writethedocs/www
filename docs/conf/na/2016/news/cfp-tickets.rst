Announcing Ticket Sales and Call for Proposals
==============================================

`Write the Docs NA 2016 <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/>`_ 
is four months away and we hope you're getting excited!
It will be another wonderful year full of great conversation and
interesting talks.

Today we are announcing our Call for Proposals and ticket sales.
Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with
our inspiring community of documentarians. 
If there is something you'd really like to see a talk on this year,
submit a talk on it,
or refer someone else who would be good!

Tickets
-------

We believe that everyone who cares about this topic has a place at our
event. We keep ticket prices low so that it is accessible to the widest
range of people possible.

This year, our ticket prices will ensure that the absolute cost of the
conference is covered, with revenue from sponsorships used to extend the
conference and make it substantially more awesome.

If you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend, please email
us at conf@writethedocs.org, and we can work on getting you reduced
price tickets.
