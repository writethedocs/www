Thanks for coming to Write the Docs North America 2016
======================================================

Hi everyone,

Thanks for attending our fourth North American Write the Docs conference in Portland! We're so grateful to our sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and attendees for making the conference possible. 

We hope you had a wonderful time, and that you are as excited as we are about the beautiful community that is forming. Below we've included all of the resources you might need for staying in touch, like videos, the Write the Docs Slack, and our forum. We also have a short anonymous survey for you to fill out, so we can make the conference even better next year.

## Tell us how we did

Let us know how we can improve for future conferences and gatherings. We really appreciate your candid feedback!

**Our three question survey is quick and easy, so [go fill it out](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EId9qofs5N5ivE4PWi9awlco3r6yn1gikSJwBc6F8OU/viewform).**

## Speak or Sponsor in Europe

Don't forget we have our European conference this year in Prague! The [Call for Proposals](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2016/cfp/) is open until **June 10**.

We're also looking for more sponsors to make the Prague event just as magical as this year's Portland event. If you are curious about sponsoring EU or NA again next year,
please contact us at [sponsorship@writethedocs.org](mailto:sponsorship@writethedocs.org).

You can find information about the conference and Call for Proposals on our [European Conference website](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2016/).

## Videos

All the videos for the conference are now posted. You can see all the videos from this year of Write the Docs on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmV2D6sIiX3U03qc-FPXgLFGFkccCEtfv). Thanks again to our wonderful video folks at [Next Day Video](http://nextdayvideo.com/) for turning them around so quickly.

## Write the Docs Slack

The Write the Docs Slack has really taken off this year! Our general Slack channel has been extra busy in the days and weeks leading up to the conference, and we hope that y'all continue the conversations throughout the year. If you haven't joined, head on over and join us! We're at [Write the Docs Slack](https://writethedocs.slack.com/).

## Meetups

We hope you continue to [build the community](http://www.writethedocs.org/meetups/) and keep in touch with other documentarians in your hometown. In this spirit, we have a number of meetups in cities across the country. If you don't see your city [listed](http://www.writethedocs.org/meetups/), consider [starting](http://www.writethedocs.org/meetups/starting/) a meetup! 

Keep us posted if you start one (or encounter a new one) so that we can spread the word.

## Notes

We understand that some folks who participated in the unconf sessions took notes. If you'd like to share your notes (or notes about any of the main talks), post them wherever you like and provide a link on the general Slack channel, or in a forum thread. We're sure your fellow attendees, and the folks who couldn't attend, will appreciate it mightily!

## Thanks again

The conference is possible only because folks like you make it a great experience.
Thanks for making it another wonderful year.
We hope to see you back again next year,
or even sooner at one of our other events that happen throughout the year.
