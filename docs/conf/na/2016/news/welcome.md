Welcome to Write the Docs
=========================

Hello Documentarians,

The conference is just a few days away. Some reminders and late-breaking information:

* If you'll be here on or before Saturday, be aware that TriMet, Portland's public transit system, will be working on the light rail lines. Public transit is generally excellent in Portland, but through May 21 trains will be crowded, and schedules will be limited. For more information, see [the TriMet website](http://trimet.org/alerts/firstavenue.htm).
* If you're planning to join us for the hike on Saturday, make sure that you've [gotten your free ticket](https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-2016-hike). There's a limited number of spaces, although there should be plenty of room for everyone who wants to join.
* **Join us on Sunday at [CENTRL Office](https://goo.gl/maps/xljmU)**. The [Writing Day](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/writing-day/ is from *9am-6pm*, immediately followed by the reception from *6pm-9pm*. **Both events are at CENTRL Office.** Here's a [map](https://goo.gl/maps/xljmU) of the location. You can pick up your badge and enjoy a couple of drinks on us. This is a great chance to meet your fellow documentarians before the conference starts.
* **Follow the [Code of Conduct](http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/)**. We have a wonderful community full of diverse and amazing people. We expect everyone to behave in a respectful manner at all conference events. Our code of conduct boils down to "Be excellent to each other", but the [full text](http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/) is also available. Our cell phone numbers and email addresses are on that page if you ever need to contact us.
* **Plan a [lightning talk](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/lightning-talks/)**. We'll have lightning talks each day after lunch. These are 5 minute presentations and a lot of fun. They can be about anything you want. This is your chance to share something you are passionate about with the audience. Slides are not required.
* **Plan a discussion**. We'll be running the [Unconference](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/unconference/) in the afternoon on Monday and Tuesday. Want to chat with like-minded folks about a very specific thing? This is the place. We'll have a sign-up board so you know what's happening, and supplies to help you brainstorm.
* **Come to the party on Monday night.** This is a private party just for conference attendees. Plan to attend so you can get to know folks in the community. We'll be at [Jack Knife](https://goo.gl/maps/UF1PgcfKWNS2) with a bunch of awesome free food and drinks.
* **Coffee, breakfast, and lunch are provided.** Don't worry about coffee before you come to the conference on Monday or Tuesday. Coffee and breakfast are served at 8:15, and the conference starts at 9.
* **Use the hash tag #writethedocs.** Twitter is a great way to communicate at events. If you arrive into Portland early and want to find others, use the hash tag or tweet at @writethedocs. We can point you to something good.
* **Get excited.** This is the fourth year of Write the Docs, and our community is growing. We have a fantastic venue in a beautiful city, and lots of interesting talks. Come ready to meet other people in the community, and have a great time.

See you soon!
