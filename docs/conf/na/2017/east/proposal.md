# Write the Docs East: Call for Venue Proposal 2017

It’s time to think about Write the Docs 2017! 
We are hoping to split the North American conference into an East and West coast event,
and we're looking for proposals for the East coast host city.
This will bring us to 3 total conferences:

* Write the Docs West (Portland) - May 13-16, 2017 (tentative dates)
* Write the Docs East (Unknown) - Unknown
* Write the Docs Europe (Unknown) - Fall 2017

So you want your city to host Write the Docs East? Hurrah! We’re delighted by your interest. Here’s what you need to know, and what we need to know, to consider your proposal.

For 2017, we don't have a set date in mind. 
The West event will be in May 2017,
so take this into account in your planning.
It likely makes sense to do the event in the Fall,
but we'll also be doing a European event too that we'll need to coordinate.
We don't see much attendee cross-over between the EU and NA events though,
so we could hold them close to each other without too much worry.

**We are open to alternative event ideas**.
We are imagining a three day conference similar to our West event,
but that might be overly ambitious for the first East event.
So feel free to suggest a smaller,
one-day or two-day event,
if that seems more manageable.

### Proposal Information

We need some information about your city, about the venue, and travel. Your proposal doesn’t have to be super-fancy, just informative. The proposal should include the following:

1. Names of organizer staff in the host city. While Write the Docs, LLC will handle the business aspects of the conference, we need the help of a team of local volunteers to manage preparation and the onsite coordination of the event. We realize you won't have an entire team assembled, but let us know who the core organizers in your city will be.

2. A short list of possible conference venues (or just one, if you have found the Venue of Conference Dreams), with the following information:

    - Name
    - Location
    - Transportation options (how do people get there from the airport?)
    - Attendance capacity
    - Layout of function space:
        - Session room to accommodate 250-300 people, preferably with some table seating
        - (Optional, but recommended) Room for an unconference session that can sit up to 50-75 people
        - Green room for speakers to prepare (generally a room that will seat 25 for a workshop is the right size)
        - Location of registration tables
        - Location of meals and breaks with sufficient seating and tables. 
        - Location of supplemental beverage stations for daylong service.
        - Secure overnight storage for vendor booth supplies and conference registration desk items.

    - Catering:
        - Main conference, 2 days—250 people per day: Breakfast, morning break, lunch, afternoon break, and all day beverage service.  (All day beverage service includes water stations, coffee, assorted black and herbal teas, and a variety of soft drinks.)
        - Writing Day, 1 day—75 people each day: Breakfast, morning break, lunch, afternoon break, and all day beverage service.  (All day beverage service includes water stations, coffee, assorted black and herbal teas, and a variety of soft drinks.)
        - Catering must have options for vegetarians and vegans of equal quality and variety as main menu. Estimate 15% vegetarian and 5% vegan.

    - Costs for:
        - Function space
        - Catering
        - Audio-visual services
        - Any other fees or costs the venue requires.

    A good conference venue is/has the following:

    - Easy to reach from the airport and the conference hotel
    - Free parking if a car is required for access
    - The ability to serve lunch to 250 people in a 60 minute window.
    - Most venues require use of their in-house catering service. If the venue does not offer catering services, check whether the venue restricts catering access to an approved vendor list, and what, if any, requirements they have for outside catering vendors.
    - Adjoins or within walking distance to a suitable hotel which can accommodate 250 attendees
    - Excellent Internet connectivity   
    - [Accessible](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/organizing-more-accessible-tech-events) to as many attendees as possible
    - Reasonable access to transit for sightseeing 

    We recommend looking at concert venues and other non-traditional event spaces.
    They tend to have a more interesting vibe, 
    and also be cheaper to rent.
    Other options might be universities,
    software company corporate campuses,
    and other sites that might like to partner with our event.

3. A short list of possible Writing Day venues, with the following information:

    - Name
    - Location
    - Transportation options 
    - Attendance capacity
    - Cost of function space, catering, and audio-visual services. Sprints are often hosted by local companies as sponsorship of the event, which is preferable, as it saves the cost of renting a venue.

    A good venue is/has the following:
    - Easy to reach from the conference hotel
    - Free parking if a car is required for access
    - A room to hold 50-75 people, with work tables, chairs, power, and internet connectivity
    - See catering requirements above.  Eating tables should be separate from work tables if at all possible.
    - Excellent Internet connectivity

4. Hotels. Ideal hotels are a very short walk away. For the hotel, we need at least one option that is affordable (eg. not 4-star), and needs the following info:

    - Name
    - Location
    - Transportation options (how do people get there from the airport?)
    - Cost of room per night (Generally we don't get a block of rooms because of the liability, we mainly just want to know a general cost)

 
5.  Provide estimates on costs associated with flights, accommodation, meals, ground transportation, etc. for an overview of total cost for attendees.

6. Information about what makes the city a good choice for Write the Docs East and an attractive destination for attendees.

7. Any additional ideas for making the event especially useful and/or memorable.

Since we are considering a number of proposals, **no one from your group** should sign a binding contract or make any kind of legal or financial commitment.

If Write the Docs chooses your group's proposal, your group is responsible for putting Write the Docs in contact with the venue management to finalize the event agreement.

**Please submit your proposal no later than July 30, 2016.**

### Examples

This is our first year trying to do conference proposals,
so we don't have a history of Write the Docs proposals.
However,
here are a couple other interesting proposals that you can look at for inspiration:

* [Plone Conference Proposal](https://old.plone.org/events/conferences/plone-conference-2016/boston-proposal-2016/view)
* [Perl Conference Proposal](http://news.perlfoundation.org/2007/08/yapcna2008-chicagopm-bid.html)

Thanks so much! We look forward to hearing about all the fantastic places we can go next year!
