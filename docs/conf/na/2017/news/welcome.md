Welcome to Write the Docs
=========================

Hello Documentarians,

The conference is just a few days away. 
We have some reminders, late-breaking information, and a few thanks are in order.

We hope you're getting excited!

Info
----

* **Riding the trains**. Be aware that TriMet, Portland's public transit system, will be working on the light rail lines. This means that you can't easily get from the Airport to downtown without a transfer. Public transit is generally excellent in Portland, but trains might be crowded, and schedules will be limited. For more information, see our [visiting page](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/visiting/#the-max) and [the TriMet website](https://trimet.org/alerts/morrisonyamhill/).
* **Riding a bike**. Portland has a fancy new [bike share program](https://www.biketownpdx.com/), and they've given us a discount code for you. You can use `WRITE17` for half off your first day pass.
* **Walking a trail**. If you're planning to join us for the [hike](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/hike/) on Saturday at *2pm*, make sure that you've already got a ticket. It looks like it will probably rain a little, so make sure you have a rain jacket!
* **Read the [Welcome Wagon Guide](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/welcome-wagon/)**. It is packed full of information on how to get the most out of the conference.
* **Join us on Sunday at the Crystal Ballroom for the Writing Day, Workshops, and the Reception.** The [Writing Day](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/writing-day/) is open to everyone, and runs from *9am-6pm*, immediately followed by the Reception from *6pm-8:30pm*. The [Workshops](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/workshops/) run from 9-5, are ticketed separately, and are sold out. **All events are at the Crystal Ballroom.** You can pick up your badge and enjoy a couple of drinks. This is a great chance to meet your fellow documentarians before the conference starts. **Plan to come to the Crystal ballroom whenever you get in on Sunday**.
* **Follow the [Code of Conduct](http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/)**. We have a wonderful community full of diverse and amazing people. We expect everyone to behave in a respectful manner at all conference events. Our code of conduct boils down to "Be excellent to each other", but the [full text](http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/) is also available. Our cell phone numbers and email addresses are on that page if you ever need to contact us.
* **Plan a [lightning talk](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/lightning-talks/)**. We'll have lightning talks each day after lunch. These are 5 minute presentations and a lot of fun. They can be about anything you want. This is your chance to share something you are passionate about with the audience. Slides are not required.
* **A small schedule change**. The person who was scheduled to be our last speaker has had to cancel because of a family emergency. We'll be adding another set of lightning talks during this time, because we always have more than we have time for. Sorry about that!
* **Plan a discussion**. We'll be running the [Unconference](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/unconference/) in the afternoon on Monday and all day Tuesday. Want to chat with like-minded folks about a very specific thing? This is the place. We'll have a sign-up board so you know what's happening, and supplies to help you brainstorm.
* **Come to the party on Monday night.** This is a private party just for conference attendees. Plan to attend so you can get to know folks in the community. We'll be at [Jack Knife](https://goo.gl/maps/UF1PgcfKWNS2), 614 SW 11th Ave, with a bunch of free food and drinks.
* **Coffee, breakfast, and lunch are provided.** Don't worry about coffee before you come to the conference on Monday or Tuesday. Coffee and breakfast are served at 8:15, and the conference starts at 9. We have [published a list of the food](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/venue/#dietary-requirements) that we'll be serving, which might help with your meal planning.
* **Use the hash tag [#writethedocs](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23writethedocs&src=tyah).** Twitter is a great way to communicate at events. If you arrive into Portland early and want to find others, use the hash tag or tweet at @writethedocs. We can point you to something good.
