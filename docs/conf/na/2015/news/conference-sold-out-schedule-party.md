Conference sells out, Schedule Details, and Party Venue
=======================================================

These are exciting times for Write the Docs -- 
the conference is next week, and we hope you're getting ready!
We've officially sold out the conference at 350 documentarians,
who will be converging on Portland for two delightful days of documentation diving
(or three, if your schedule permits).
We just sent off the order for badges,
and everything is getting quite real.

If you missed this year's Portland conference, worry not!
Our [European conference](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/) will be in Prague at the end of August,
and the [Call for Proposals](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/cfp/) is still open.
Tell all your European friends,
or take the trip with us.

Full Schedule
--------------

We have announced the final [schedule](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2015/schedule/) for the conference. 
The schedule includes all conference-related activities -- 
the hike, the writing day, the reception, the party, and of course the actual talks.
We have packed a lot into a few days,
so I hope you're ready!

Party Venue
-----------

The conference party on Monday night will be held at TILT,
where we have rented out a full side of the restaraunt.
**Party time is from 7pm-11pm**, so make sure to come!

[TILT](http://www.tiltitup.com/) is located at 1355 NW Everett St,
in the same block as CENTRL Office where we will be the day before.
Here's a [map](https://goo.gl/maps/ZoKCP) with directions from the venue.
It's only a few minute walk.

We'll have lots of free food and free drinks,
plus it's a great chance to get to know the other attendees better.
Please keep it responsible though, and remember,
we have another day of exciting talks on Tuesday :)

Get Excited
-----------

Even if you're not presenting a formal talk, there's still plenty you
can do to participate.
Start planning a [lightning talk](lightning-talks).
Think about things to chat about at the [unconference](unconference).
Get a project ready to document at the [Writing Day](writing-day).
We're excited about all the things, and we hope you're getting that way too!
