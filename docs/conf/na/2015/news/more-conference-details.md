Sunday - Writing Day and Conference Reception
---------------------------------------------

During the day on Sunday, we'll have our [Writing Day][writing-day]
, followed by the preregistration party in the evening.

All events on Sunday are at CENTRL Office, located
at 1355 NW Everett St ([map][centrl-map]).  Head there at any point during the
day to pick up your badge, join a doc sprint, or party
in the evening and meet some of your fellow attendees.

The Writing Day is modeled after the concept of ["sprints"][sprints] from
the open source and software development worlds. The idea is simple: to get a
bunch of interesting people in a room together and have them work towards shared
goals.

Sprint projects include
Mozilla's [MDN][mdn], [Wordpress][wordpress], and Write the Docs's [resources for
documentarians][wtd-resources]. [OpenNews][opennews] will join us to
bring open source to journalism. You are also welcome to bring your own project
to work on, or feel free to suggest your project for sprints and get others
involved.

We encourage everyone to drop by on Sunday evening for our conference reception.
You'll have a chance to get acquainted with each other over some drinks and
snacks. We'll also help groups organize dinner plans so that you can continue
your conversations over more substantial food.

Monday and Tuesday - Conference
-------------------------------

We've released the breakdown of [our daily schedule][schedule], and we'll 
release the full talk schedule soon. The doors
open at 8am on both days, so that you can get there early, get yourself settled,
and grab some breakfast. Our keynote presentations begin at 9:15am. Talks 
run all day, until shortly after 5pm. There will be plenty of breaks between talks, and breaks
for snacks and lunch.

We'll hold an unconference downstairs in Lola's Room again this year, again on
both days. The unconference begins shortly after lunch,
and will continue until the end of the day. Sessions begin with a
couple of topics to get you started, followed by time for unstructured topics.
