# Schedule

Write the Docs is more than a conference.  Each year we organize a wide range
of events so that people can come together, collaborate, and learn from each
other in different ways.

## Saturday, May 16th

The only event scheduled on Saturday is the [annual hike to Pittock Mansion][hike].
If you get into town early, join us on the hike and take the chance to explore
Portland in all of its glory.

## Sunday, May 17th

During the day, we'll hold our [Writing Day documentation sprints][writing-day],
followed by the conference reception in the evening.

**The base of operations for all our events on Sunday is CENTRL Office, located
at 1355 NW Everett St.** Head there at any point during the day to pick up your
badge, and take the opportunity to work on some documentation at the sprints. 

We encourage everyone to drop by on Sunday evening for the conference
reception. You'll have a chance to get acquainted with each other over some
drinks and snacks. We'll also help groups organize dinner plans, so you
can continue your conversations over more substantial food as well.
