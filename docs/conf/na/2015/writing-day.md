## Writing Day

This year, Write the Docs will have a new Writing Day, modeled after the concept of [sprints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_%28software_development%29) from the open source world. The idea is simple: to get a bunch of interesting people in a room together and have them work towards shared goals.

To make the most out of the Writing Day, we recommend that you either come with a project, or be ready and willing to contribute to someone else's project.

Here are some examples of projects that you might want to work on:

* Open source software documentation
* General documentation writing
* Best practices manual (For your company, or the world)
* Blog posts 
* Tips and tricks 
* Great works of fiction 
* Love letters
* The Documentarian Manifesto

You get the idea.

All this adds up to a room full of smart people sharing your problems, your passion, and your goals.
So be ready to learn some new things and to teach others what you know.

Even if you [feel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) as though you don't know that much, we know you have a lot to offer. Come surprise yourself with how much you can share.

#### Logistics

Please bring a computer or some other mechanism with which to create written words.

We'll be creating and editing content, so make sure that you have the tools you need to contribute.

-   Date & Time: **Sunday, May 17th, 9am-6pm**, with the conference opening reception in the same space until 9, so feel free to keep working longer!
-   Venue: CENTRL Office - 1355 NW Everett St. [Map](https://goo.gl/maps/xljmU)
-   Sustenance: Mozilla will provide food and drinks throughout the day so that you can focus on *Getting Sh\*t Done*.

#### Projects

We have some suggestions for projects that you can work on during the Writing Day.
If you'd like to add your own project to the list, you can [email us](mailto:conf@writethedocs.org). Better yet, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/writethedocs/www/blob/master/docs/conf/na/2015/writing-day.md).

##### [Open News](http://opennews.org/blog/code-convening-wtd/) 

The Open News team has multiple open source journalism projects whose documentation could use some expert love.
Help improve the docs on some amazing code that helps people understand the news everyday.

##### [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) 

Help document the internet. Mozilla always needs more people to create, edit, and translate content, so we can do more to help make the internet more approachable.

##### [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) 

WordPress powers a large portion of the internet. Help write the docs that help people set it up and use it.

##### [Write the Docs Website](http://www.writethedocs.org)

We have a website for our community, but it kinda sucks. Help us make it better by adding content, archiving old talks and notes, or just making it more friendly in general. Remember, you *are* the community.

##### [Write the Docs Guide](http://docs.writethedocs.org/) 

A guide to writing documentation. Help us make this guide great for people who want to write docs, but don't know where to start.

##### RAML-based API generator 

I’m working on the API Reference for a new web service. I have all of the APIs defined in a RAML file, which also allows me to use the same source to generate the documentation. Ideally, I’d also like to make the API reference interactive.  As examples, see <http://developer.wordnik.com/docs.html#!/account>, <https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs> or <http://developer.marvel.com/docs>.

Let's work together to make this happen at the Writing Day!

##### Your Project Here

Yup. We know you need better docs. We do too. Make it happen. 

Send us an email or pull request with your project and a short paragraph about what you need help with, and we'll include it here.
