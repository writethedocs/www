## Giving a Presentation at Write the Docs

Are you planning to speak at Write the Docs? Great! Here's a few things that may
help you plan your presentation and the slides for your presentation.

### Presentation

This year, we will not be allowing time after the presentations for questions,
we feel posing questions for the speaker is best done on a more limited basis.
If any attendees have questions, they will be instructed to come up to stage to
present them to the speaker, rather than take up the time of the rest of the
audience.

Make sure when you practice your presentation, you are not counting on extra
time at the end for speaker questions. You should plan on speaking for the full
extent of your speaking slot. Don't worry if you run a little short on time
however, we are happy to provide attendees with extra time during talk breaks.

This should go without saying, but make sure to practice your talk ahead of the
conference a good deal. If you haven't spoken before, your time will likely run
a lot shorter on stage than when you are practicing. Matt Haughey
wrote a [guide on giving a presentation][introverts-guide] that might be a
tremendous help to you if you are new to presenting in front of audiences.

### Slides

Slides should be in 16:9 resolution, though we can support 4:3 as well.  As a
back up plan, try to get us a PDF version of your slides. This will allow us to
have everyone's talks ready to display if there are any technical issues the
day of the conference.

You'll be responsible for making sure your laptop, or other display device, is
ready for your presentation. Be familiar with setting up an external display on
your machine, each presenter will have several minutes for set up before the
talk starts.

In case you missed it last year, here's a talk by Christina Elmore that gives a
great perspective on documentation versus presentation:
