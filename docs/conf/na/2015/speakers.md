    <h4>Keynote: We Are All Abbott and Costello</h4>
    <p>
      Documentarians and technical writers have seen many changes in our
      professions in recent years, and there’s no sign of change slowing down.
      One thing endures: the writer's goal of communicating to understanding.
      It’s not as easy as it sounds. Because we are all Abbott and Costello.

    <h4>Keynote: The Federated Wiki</h4>
    <p>
      Just as the first wiki changed how people write, our new wiki will change
      how people work. By pushing steadily on two fundamental ideas,
      refactoring to ease improvement and federation to ease sharing, we have
      once again uncovered a simpler and more powerful internet.

    <h4>How to Write Documentation for People that Don't Read</h4>
    <p>
      It's 3AM, do you know where your users are? If people want to learn how
      to use your product, where are they looking for help? Are they on your
      site, and if they're on your site, are they finding the right page?
    </p>
    <p>
      Usability researchers have known for decades that users don't read word
      by word - they *scan* for the content they want.
    </p>
    <p>
      If users can't make heads or tails of your documentation, they'll give up
      (a loss of revenue), remain ignorant of product features (another loss of
      revenue) or ask needless support questions (an increased cost).
    </p>
    <p>
      In this talk we'll examine the *findability* of your documentation, and
      the text on the pages in your documentation. We'll examine usability
      research into how users read, look at several ways your documentation is
      failing busy users, and the lessons I learned conducting user tests at
      Twilio. We'll learn more about how users find the answers they are
      looking for, and the importance of spreading clear writing across not
      just your documentation, but your headlines and error messages in your
      API.

    <h4>Documentation, Disrupted How Two Technical Writers Changed Google Engineering Culture, Built a Team, Made Powerful Friends, And Got Their Mojo Back</h4>
    <p>
      Last year, we were inspired to action by a presentation at Write the
      Docs. This talk will tell the story of what happened next: how, in two
      quarters, we worked with a small self-forming team of amazing writers and
      engineers to build a platform in six months is well on the way to
      becoming a part of the standard Google engineering workflow. We’ll share
      how that platform transformed our role as technical writers and our
      relationship with engineering. We’ll cover design and implementation
      details, but we’ll also talk about our experience - how we learned that
      being audacious (but not reckless), focused (but open and generous), and
      unafraid could revitalize our whole approach to work and save us from
      burnout.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll talk about our ever-growing appetite for disruption: How it changed
      beyond recognition our relationships with engineers, fellow writers, and
      senior leadership, making us fall in love again with our roles as
      documentarians.

    <h4>Elevating the Hedgehog: Creativity in Tech Writing</h4>
    <p>
      "People who hope to thrive in the Conceptual Age must understand the
      connections between diverse, and seemingly separate, disciplines." So
      says Daniel Pink in his book, A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will
      Rule the Future. In this talk, I assert that tech writers are a natural
      fit to help their organizations transition from the Information Age to
      the Conceptual Age.  I'll also give and seek ideas on how we as writers
      can apply Pink's six aptitudes -- storytelling, empathy, design, humor,
      games, and finding meaning -- to make our work more fulfilling, if not
      more competitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key underlying message for those who attend this talk is: YOU are a
      designer. Even if you haven't traditionally seen yourself in this role,
      writers are information designers who serve a unique, user-focused and
      holistic function on development teams. By recognizing that fact, and
      opening up space in your work life for creativity, you can have an even
      bigger impact and a more fulfilling career.

    <h4>Entry points and guide posts: Helping new contributors find their way</h4>
    <p>
      How did Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) achieve a 46% increase in active
      editors and a 90% increase in translation contributions in 2014? Many
      factors helped, but a major element was the support we added for new
      contributors.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Scratch your own itch” is the proverbial invitation to contribute to
      open source projects. How well this works for contributing to code is
      open to debate, but it rarely makes sense for open source documentation,
      especially for well-established projects. Not only is it unhelpful for
      the project, which typically has plans (or at least wishlists) for
      improving the docs, but it provides very little guidance to the
      contributor as to what they might do, what they personally are able to
      do, and what would be most helpful to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the 10 years that MDN has been a wiki (some of the content pre-dates
      the wiki), the community has always welcomed constructive contributions
      by anyone who bothers to create a user account. Over the years, we’ve
      created meta-documentation about contributing to the site, including
      wishlists of things we’d like to see documented. However, these didn’t
      necessarily help newcomers gain traction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only in the last year or so have we created documentation to help new
      contributors specifically. Our aim is to help newcomers find the right
      match among:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Topics and tasks the person is interested in (what they like)</li>
      <li>Tasks the person has the skills and time to do (what they can do)</li>
      <li>Tasks that help MDN meet the goals that Mozilla has set (what we need/want)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I’ll describe the features we’ve put in place to achieve this, as well as
      things we’re still working on. I’ll leave space for discussion so we can
      all share ideas and successes.

    <h4>Success is More Than Not Failing</h4>
    <p>
      We talk a lot about minimum viable products, and building our products up
      from small features. We talk a lot about failure, and how to learn from
      it and not replicate failures over and over again. But what I haven’t
      heard a lot of discussion about is how we know we’ve succeeded. Is it
      market share? Usable product? Could understanding and setting a
      measurable, achievable goals help us overcome imposter syndrome, second
      sock syndrome, and feature creep?
    </p>
    <p>
      This talk provides some metrics on identifying success, documenting what
      it will look like when you get there, preserving the idea, and dealing
      with the inevitable distractions and changes in direction that may
      prevent you from ending up where you expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      I plan to speak on how documentation can serve a crucial function at both
      defining and driving success. We need to stop believing that agile is the
      end of the answer and embrace it as part of building what we want to have
      in the end.

      Continuous improvement can have a victory condition, if we build it.

    <h4>A Developers Approach to Documentation: From Passive to Dynamic</h4>
    <p>
      The era of O’Reilly books is done, finito, kaput. With so much of the
      developer experience online, we know a great deal about each individual
      user and about the code we document. Why, then, do we documentarians
      persist in providing the same walls of text to each of our readers,
      especially when there are so many more personalized ways of describing
      technical tools and code?
    </p>
    <p>
      This talk addresses the move from passive to dynamic documentation. As
      code goes mainstream, more and more consumers of APIs and technical
      writing will be non-technical. Technical writing bears a responsibility
      to reduce the learning curve as much as possible for these readers, and
      it can do that by being much more intimate about its relationship with
      them.

    <h4>How GitHub uses GitHub to document GitHub</h4>
    <p>
      Everyone knows that GitHub is the place to host your project's code. What
      you may not know is that the same workflow developers use to create,
      update, and manage their software is also used to create, update, and
      manage GitHub's documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      https://help.github.com is GitHub's second-most viewed site--after the
      main website itself. I'd like to provide a somewhat opinionated look on
      how our valiant Documentation team writes and releases content for
      features on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise. I'll go over:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>How our teams (Development, Security, Docs, etc) coordinate before launching a feature</li>
      <li>The importance of opening pull requests early</li>
      <li>The review/edit cycle with peers</li>
      <li>How we incorporate DITA best practices into our Markdown documentation</li>
      <li>Validating content through CI and automated tests</li>

    <h4>What Can Brownfield Do For You?</h4>
    <p>
      As documentarians, we are rarely afforded an opportunity to thrive in a
      pristine greenfield environment. Sometimes we are asked to resurrect an
      existing documentation system which had fallen into a derelict state over
      many years. To turn this ship around, we must shepherd contents, customer
      base, and internal Subject Matter Experts into a future state where
      outdated, neglected, and ambiguous support documents are transformed into
      timely, relevant, and pleasing works of art.
    </p>

    <p>
      The role of the documentarian is to help execute this transformation.
      However, we are often asked (or voluntold) by our organizations to wear
      other hats beyond our primary writing duties: repair and build
      relationships, analyze business processes, learn about how others react
      to change, discover unknown troves of documentation, train and encourage
      the next generation of writers, gather and crunch data, tell stories,
      design workflows, and perform “other duties as needed.” Some may respond
      with an exasperated “I wasn’t trained on this!!!” or “That’s not part of
      my job!” But those of us who embrace the opportunity to stretch beyond
      our areas of expertise and learn new peripheral skills may realize that
      working on a documentation equivalent of a cleaning up Superfund site can
      turn into super fun.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this talk, I will share my experiences and lessons learned as a
      technical writer who is witnessing this documentation culture change, one
      conversation at a time. Wearing many hats can be exhilarating and
      rewarding.

    <h4>Writer, Meet Tester</h4>
    <p>
      While our APIs are still in development, we gather feedback internally.
      We established an API design review board to approve every API change --
      this made a huge difference in ensuring that we offer a consistent,
      easy-to-consume programmatic interface to our users. We also conduct
      regular “dogfooding” sessions in which users are provided with draft
      documentation and asked to find both doc and product bugs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our testers created an automated mechanism to alert us of any API changes
      in case anything slipped past the review board. It’s proven to be
      invaluable for both doc and testing to keep up with the various teams who
      are building functionality into the API.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once our APIs are publicly available, we take pride in listening to our
      users in help forums, on Twitter, and through pilot programs. We’ve
      clarified our documentation and added test cases numerous times based on
      customer pain points.

    <h4>Let’s Tell a Story: Scenario-Based Documentation</h4>
    <p>
      To new users, complex software products can seem like dark woods on a
      stormy day. As tech writers, we often spend a lot of time talking about
      the overall shape of the forest and the variety of paths within it
      (conceptual docs), creating detailed catalogs of local tree species
      (reference docs), and providing step-by-step guides to things like “how
      to cross a river” or “how to knock on a door” (task-based docs).
    </p>
    <p>
      But none of that helps your customers when they just want to know how to
      get to Grandmother’s house, without getting lost in the forest, falling
      into the river, and accidentally going to the other cabin in the woods,
      where the lycanthropic senior citizens live.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, your customers need a narrative. And maybe they need lots
      of them. When you’re dealing with products that can be run and configured
      in a bewildering variety of ways, a single getting started manual might
      not do the trick. It’s like giving people a Choose Your Own Adventure
      book and only allowing them to choose one path through to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my talk I’ll explain how we became aware of the need for better
      scenario-based documentation, and how we ended up building a prototype
      during a hack week project. Now we’re on our way to creating a collection
      of short stories that show users how to string sets of features and
      procedures together to solve complex problems. We’ll cover some of the
      things we’ve learned along the way and offer best practices for those who
      want to tell a few stories of their own.

    <h4>Designing Information for Growth</h4>
    <p>
      Every tech company or organization organically produces docs in some
      form, but as scale increases, the information design decisions you
      started with will almost certainly serve some information consumers
      better than others. Depending on who's creating information and who's
      using it, the approach to designing and delivering information can be
      dramatically different, with very different outcomes that probably won't
      work across an entire larger organization. Be aware of the information
      design decisions you're making so you can plan for growth. Design by
      default is not a good strategy!
    </p>

    <p>
      This talk discusses how:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Information inherently includes design, whether or not you meant to do it. Information also requires design, no matter how simple and straightforward it may seem.</li>
      <li>Technical information can be roughly sorted into modes such as descriptive, defensive, procedural, and tutorial. (These are *different* from concept-task-reference.)</li>
      <li>Each of these modes has different design implications that address different audiences and needs.</li>
      <li>Being aware of your design priorities can help you understand how to make your stakeholders happier as your documentation base grows with the organization.</li>

    <h3>Emily Hoffmann & Alfonso Roman</h3>
    <h4>A brief history of math writing: symbol, structure, and proof</h4>
    <p>
      A mathematical proof is a logically rigorous way of showing that
      something is true. It begins with a statement of the desired result and
      any assumptions that must be made. It guides the reader through a set of
      logical sequential steps, supported by figures to aid intuition or
      cross-references for prerequisite knowledge. It ends by declaring that
      the desired result has been achieved. At risk of insulting every
      mathematician who ever lived, in many ways a proof is not so different
      from a grand, abstract how-to document.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps surprisingly, for most of human history mathematical proofs and
      mathematics itself have been written in prose. Even those of us who
      cringe at the memory of high school algebra can agree that “10x + y^2 =
      3” is more user-friendly than “the sum of an unknown quality multiplied
      by ten and another unknown quantity multiplied by itself is equal to
      three”. The first part of this talk explores the development of
      mathematical writing, which can be divided into improvements in symbolic
      representation and improvements in structure. This discussion is partly
      inspired by Bret Victor’s observation that the most influential
      breakthroughs in the history of mathematics were actually breakthroughs
      in “UI design”, for example the invention of arabic numerals (0, 1, 2,
      3,...) as a replacement for clunky roman numerals (I, II, III, IV…).
    </p>

    <p>
      Proofs and rigorous documentation empower their readers to greater
      understanding by never relying on authority or persuasion. A mathematical
      proof, unlike a scientific experiment or a souffle recipe, must show that
      the desired result is *always* achieved when the right steps are executed
      under the right conditions. Users of computer applications certainly
      expect documentation to live up to the same standards. The second part of
      this talk explores the concept of mathematical proof in more depth. We
      will look at how proofs are structured and use logic in a particular way
      to minimize ambiguity and maximize credibility, and how the writing
      process is itself a powerful tool to root out hidden assumptions and
      errors in thinking.

      high-level look at what I’ll share:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A brief discussion of continuous deployment: what does it mean, especially for tech writers and others involved in the process?</li>
      <li>A look at some things that have worked for us. Making the mental shift from releases to features has been an absolute necessity. We’ve also had to change the tooling we use, the processes we follow, and the way we communicate. This journey has also forced us to consider what the documentation equivalent of an MVP (minimal viable product in Agile development) looks like.</li>
      <li>There are a few things that haven’t worked out very well! Resource-heavy deliverables (like videos and tutorials) are really difficult to maintain. Communication also  increases in importance in a rapidly-paced cycle. These and other areas provide us with some good lessons learned.</li>
      <li>The jury is still out on a few experiments! Things like investing more heavily in in-app help and automating doc publication in tandem with code deployment are among the experiments we’re attempting to get better at this new world.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>User-Story Driven Docs</h4>
    <p>
      At OutSystems we make an awesome development platform, but our
      documentation wasn't that awesome. We focused on describing each button
      available on the user interface, and not the user intentions and goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      A clear example of this, was that we had a full documentation page for
      the find text feature (CTRL+F). It described in excruciating detail every
      option available on the UI, but didn't told our users how they could
      actually find what they needed!
    </p>
    <p>
      For us it was a nightmare to maintain the docs. Our development
      environment was constantly changing and we couldn't keep up with the
      changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      More importantly, we weren't meeting the user needs. And that was clear
      from pages with a single-digit page view, and from the feedback we got
      from our customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to this approach, we also ended up having page titles that were
      feature-oriented, which is not the best for SEO.  For instance, the doc
      page for the find text feature was called "Find Tool".  Who in their
      right mind would search for that on Google?
    </p>
    <p>
      In this talk I'll tell you the story of how we stopped trying to document
      the UI, and started creating user-story driven docs.  We now focus on
      what the user wants to achieve and how to achieve it, independently of
      how many windows or buttons they need to go through.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll cover:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        How you can check if you're documenting the UI, and why you should
        avoid doing it
      </li>
      <li>Why users stories work better for our users</li>
      <li>
        How focusing on user stories changed the culture of our team and
        allowed us to work on what really matters.
      </li>
      <li>
        I'll also share some unexpected outcomes, like how this lead us to work
        closer than ever with the development teams. Now our users get twice
        the cake: better features and better docs!
