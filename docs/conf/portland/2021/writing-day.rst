The Good Docs Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `Good Docs Project <https://thegooddocsproject.dev/>`_ is an open source community of technical writers, doc tools experts, and software engineers who are committed to improving the quality of documentation in open source by creating the templates, tools, and resources to empower everyone to create great docs. Come visit our table at Writing Days to provide feedback and collaborate with some of our working group captains on some of our key 2021 initiatives:

- **Templates for community docs** - Every open source community should have some baseline community documentation like a good README, Contributing Guide, PR and issue templates, Code of Conduct, etc. Come provide feedback and suggest improvements on our drafts of templates for some of these core community docs.
- **Docs advocacy and education** - Part of improving docs in open source is getting buy-in from developers about why docs matter and the best practices. Come see our proof of concept storyboards and discuss some of our ideas for an ongoing series of short videos that will promote documentation fundamentals and best practices.
- **Easy button for docs setup** - One of the biggest hurdles to creating good documentation is setting up your initial documentation toolchain. Come collaborate with our docs tool experts who are working on creating a Hugo/Docsy repository that can be easily cloned to set up a new documentation system for a project.
- **Industrial fiction** - Our goal is to provide good examples of our project's templates being used in an actual project. To accomplish this goal, we're creating our own fake open source project that can be used to generate documentation examples. Come help us build both the world and the documentation for The Chronologue, a fake open source tool that helps future time travelers sync their clocks across multiple dimensions.

Trino project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Trino <https://trino.io>`_ is a fast distributed SQL query engine for big data analytics. We’re excited to join you Write the Docs. This is our first `Writing Day <https://trino.io/blog/2021/04/14/wtd-writing-day.html>`_! We’ll have Trino enthusiasts available to help you get started. We even made a `get started video <https://youtu.be/yseFM3ZI2ro>`_ to help you begin your journey as a Trino contributor.

Here are a few ways you can contribute to the `Trino open source docs <https://trino.io/docs/current/>`_:

- Improve our docs, we made an `issues filter <https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Adocs+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`_ to help you find ways to contribute.

  - Edit an existing document, perfect for first time contributors.

Write the Docs Meetups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Organizing local Write the Docs meetup communities is a rewarding way to participate. During Writing Day, we'll have a table where we can share tips and best practices, especially in this time where all of our meetups are virtual.

GitLab - Learn how to contribute to our open-source docs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`GitLab <https://about.gitlab.com>`_ is a DevOps platform for
the entire software development lifecycle. GitLab has everything from project planning
and source code management to CI/CD, monitoring, and security.

Our `documentation <https://docs.gitlab.com>`_ is open source and everyone can
contribute. All the content is hosted on GitLab.com, so you will need a
`GitLab.com account <https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up>`_ to get started.

For more information, see our `GitLab issue <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/technical-writing/-/issues/426>`_.

When you find an issue you want to work on:

#. Create a merge request with your proposed changes.
#. Reach out to one of the GitLab Team Members available during Writing Day, either in Hopin or in Slack.

The merge request, if acceptable, will be merged during the Writing Day session or in the following days.

After your merge request is reviewed and merged, it will appear on the docs site
shortly!

If you have any questions, you can reach out to us in Hopin or in Slack: `@selhorn`, `@amyq`, `@arty-chan`, `@mikejang`.

Write the Docs Style Guides Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Write the Docs `Style Guides <https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/style-guides>`_ is a growing collection of resources. This guide includes standards for writing and designing content and links to external resources.

Our Style Guide project goal is to improve this guide. Areas of focus include content restructuring, evaluating the content, and curating the external resource links.

Are you passionate about style guides? Do you want to learn more about them? Do you have browser bookmarks that you visit as you work (like I do)?

Experienced or early career, you're welcome join us on this "let's make an awesome style guide resource"  journey. It's our (my) first writing day project, so we'll learn together.
