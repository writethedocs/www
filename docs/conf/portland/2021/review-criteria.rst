Proposal Review Guidelines
==========================

Overview
--------

Thank you in advance for your efforts as a member of the Program Committee for the Write the Docs North America (Portland) conference, taking place May <TBD> 2022. 

These are the official CFP Scoring Guidelines and Best Practices to use when reviewing your set of proposals. Please bookmark this page for easy reference. If you have any questions, please email us.

Important Dates to Remember
---------------------------

* Program Committee Review Period:
* Must have at least 50% of your assigned proposals reviewed:
* Must have 100% of your assigned proposals reviewed:
* Schedule Announced:
* Event Dates:

Scoring Guidelines
------------------

Grade the quality of each proposal on a 5 to 1 grading scale for content, originality, relevance, and speaker(s):

* 5 (Excellent)
* 4 (Above Average)
* 3 (Score Not Allowed)
* 2 (Below Average)
* 1 (Poor)

Reminders: 

* Leave comments for each proposal you review, with the reasons for your score.
* Do not leave a score of 3.

For each proposal, you will indicate whether or not you see it ultimately being part of the accepted program by stating “yes” or “no.”

Review Process Best Practices
-----------------------------

* Time Commitment: Please plan on committing 4-50 hours total to review all of the submissions in your track, depending on the amount you have been assigned. Aim to do 10-15 sessions at a time – then take a break / walk away. This helps prevent burnout and allows you to see more proposals with fresh eyes.

* Process Integrity: It is very important to protect the integrity of the review process, and to avoid undue bias, by keeping the submissions and your comments on them confidential. Please review and adhere to our Code of Conduct.

* Public & Author Interaction: To ensure an unbiased review process, program committee members should not discuss submissions with authors and/or the overall public (i.e., please no tweeting). Of course, please feel free to tweet about accepted sessions that you are excited to attend once the schedule has been published.

* Conflict of Interest: Reviewers are asked to wear their “Write the Docs” hats rather than the company or other affiliation when scoring submissions so that you rate all submissions fairly. If a submission was written by a colleague you work closely with or someone that you are seen to be associated with or in competition with, please skip the review. Mark it as a conflict of interest.

* Review Metrics: Highlight your level of confidence in your recommendation, as well as the reasons for your score. Consider the following criteria:

  * Relevance – Does the content provide takeaways that are new and exciting instead of information that was “so last year?” Is the content relevant to the conference?
  * Originality – Is this an original presentation, instead of one that a speaker repeats at every conference?
  * Soundness – Does the content make sense in delivery or is it all over the place? Is the proposal focused?
  * Quality of Presentation – Is the proposal engaging and well thought out? Does the background material suggest the speaker will deliver this presentation effectively?
  * Importance – How important is the content for the Write the Docs audience?
  * Experience – Is this speaker a good person to deliver this presentation? Does their experience with the subject matter align with the proposed content?

* 30% Rule: You’ll be asked for each proposal, “Overall, do you want to see this session at this conference?” Only about 30% of your proposals should get a “yes” vote.
 
* Speakers with multiple submissions: We will not accept more than one talk from the same speaker. Use your comments to indicate why you prefer one talk over another.
