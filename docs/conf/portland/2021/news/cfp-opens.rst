Announcing Call for Proposals
=============================

Today we are announcing our `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/cfp/>`_.

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our inspiring community of documentarians.
If there is something youâ€™d really like to see a talk on this year, submit a proposal on it, or refer someone else who would be good!

Call for Proposals
------------------

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

You can read our full `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/cfp/>`__ on the website.

The Call for Proposals will be open until **Midnight {{cfp.ends}} PST**.

Tickets
-------

Tickets will officially go on sale in **January 2021**.

In the meantime, you can see the ticket prices on our `Tickets <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/tickets/>`_ page.
As with the previous years, we have tiered pricing to make it fair for everyone. Please buy the ticket that best fits your situation.

We keep ticket prices low so that it is accessible to the widest range of people possible.
However, if you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend, we will launch our grants program closer to the conference.
