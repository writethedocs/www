Conference highlights and thanks to the community!
==================================================

Hey everyone,

The Write the Docs team is now emerging from the post-conference
recovery period, and we wanted to send out a quick message to thank
everyone for helping to make our conference such a
success. We appreciate everyone who makes the conference possible:
speakers, sponsors, organizers, and attendees alike.

Conference recap
----------------

At **700 attendees** this conference was our biggest yet! We had
the usual mix of talks on the main stage along with Q&A,
lightning talks, unconference sessions,
writing sprints, social event, and job fair.
We thought everything went pretty smoothly this year,
including experiments like the new social event platform.

Overall, we were excited with how our awesome community come together in our new venue.
Lots of knowledge was shared, and we had a great time.

Talk videos
-----------

Videos of the talks are now available on `YouTube`_. This
includes all conference talks and Q&A, as well as the lightning talks.
You can also subscribe to our `YouTube channel`_ so you don’t miss any future content.

Thanks again to all our presenters and moderators!
Huge thanks also to `Bart at Work`_ for handling the A/V production on
our event, it was flawless once again this year.

Code of Conduct transparency report
-----------------------------------

As with any Write the Docs event,
this conference was covered by our `community Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__.
We aim to be as transparent with CoC incidents and enforcement as we can.

To ensure that our CoC was visible and accessible, we took a number of specific steps:

- Every participant agreed to the Code of Conduct in advance during registration.
- The CoC, or a summary, was included on the conference website and Hopin Reception
- The CoC was repeatedly mentioned in our conference introduction and announcements.
- We specifically stressed that the CoC applies to all conference spaces including the social event.
- We encouraged all attendees to report any incident, even if they were not sure whether it was a violation.

None of our organizers were approached about any CoC concerns at this event.
We know that this is, in part, a reflection of the thoughtful and inclusive community that we're so lucky to have.

That being said, we're also very conscious of the fact that just because
nothing was reported doesn't mean nothing happened. If there was any personal
conduct or other aspect of the conference experience that did not meet the
expectations of behavior set out in the CoC, please email us at
`conduct@writethedocs.org <mailto:conduct@writethedocs.org>`_.

Keep in touch
-------------

Don’t forget our `Prague conference`_ on **October 3-5**, and our
`Australia & India conference`_ on **December 2-3**. Tickets are on sale
now and the CFP is open for Prague, and Australia & India will be open
soon. They take place during the day in the CEST and AEDT time zones, respectively.

We’re also looking for more sponsors to make our other events just as magical as this year’s Portland event. You can see all our `sponsorship options <https://www.writethedocs.org/sponsorship/>`__ on our website.

Our Slack network has expanded yet again this year. Our #general Slack channel has been extra busy in the days and weeks leading up to the conference, and we hope that y'all continue the conversations throughout the year.
