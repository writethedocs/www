Hello!

Other sessions (such as Unconference, Hallway, and Writing Day sessions) are not recorded.

Participate in the conference
-----------------------------

The schedule is built around **sessions**. Almost all of the in-person interactions you’ll have at the virtual conference will be through sessions. Here's how to find and participate in sessions, and use these lessons for attending Writing Day, Unconference, Job Fair, and sponsor events.

Find events to participate in
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can view the schedule on the **Reception** page. You can also browse a list of events by selecting **Sessions**.
- When you select an event in the schedule, like a Writing Day or Unconference session, you are directed to the **Sessions** page.
- Once you are on the **Sessions** page, select the session you want to attend.

Join an event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Once you select a session, you can either only view the session and use the Chat, or select **Share Audio and Video** to participate in the session by video. Sessions are limited to 20 active participants, but anyone can join and view the session without video.

Helpful settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Select the **Video Camera** icon to turn off your video.
- Select the **Monitor** icon to share your screen. Multiple people can share their screens at once.

- Select the **Settings** icon to change your audio or video settings.

Writing Day
-----------

`Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/writing-day/>`__ takes place on Sunday, the day before the conference starts. You can join in anytime between 9:30am and 5pm {{tz}}.

You can bring a writing project you want to work on, or you can contribute to a project someone else brought.

- **Bring a project**: If you want help with your project, `sign up <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bE3_p0EkfPrcQzfbPj-7B0mGZQwzOo2V10jEqiVQ6hk/edit#gid=0>`__ before Writing Day. When you are ready to start your project on Writing Day, go to **Sessions**, select your table, and start collaborating.
- **Contribute to a project**: If you want to help someone else with their writing project, `check out the list of projects <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bE3_p0EkfPrcQzfbPj-7B0mGZQwzOo2V10jEqiVQ6hk/edit#gid=0>`__. When you are ready to participate, go to **Sessions**, select the session for the project you want to contribute to, and introduce yourself.

Unconference
------------

- The Unconference is a set of informal sessions that take place all day Monday and Tuesday afternoon. `Unconference talks focus on conversations and exchanges of ideas between participants. <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/unconference/>`__
- You can attend unconference sessions, or, if you have an idea for a session, you can lead one. Anyone can lead an unconference session, as long as they have a discussion idea and a willingness to encourage attendees to talk about it.
- Learn more about the Unconference by reading the `_Unconference Cheat Sheet <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/unconference-cheatsheet/>`__.

Lead an unconference session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Anyone can lead an unconference session, as long as they have a discussion idea and a willingness to encourage attendees to talk about it.
{% if flaghasschedule %}
- Look for an empty slot on the `Unconference sign-up <{{unconf.url}}>`__, and add your Unconference topic. There will be a time and a table number for each slot.
{% else %}
- Look for an empty slot on the Unconference sign-up, and add your Unconference topic. There will be a time and a table number for each slot.
{% endif %}
- When it’s time for your Unconference session to begin, go to **Sessions** and select the session that corresponds to your table number.
- The previous unconference session will be in the same table. Let the attendees of the previous session know that their time is up, and your session will begin soon.
- Once a group has entered your session, start the conversation!
- When the Unconference leader for the next session enters the session, finish up your discussion to make way for the next one.

Tips for your unconference session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Avoid doing roundtable introductions. You might run out of time to actually start the conversation!
- Start the session with a prompt: think of a question that you have about the topic of your unconference and ask it. The conversation typically works itself out after that. If there’s a lull, ask the group if anyone else has a question to ask.
- Up to 20 people can join the session with audio and video, but more people than that may join your Unconference through chat. Be sure to check the session chat regularly and include people there in the conversation.
- Be on the lookout for people who aren’t joining in and invite them to speak. Don’t insist, if they make it clear they want to listen only.

Join an unconference session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{% if flaghasschedule %}
- Starting Monday morning, check the`Unconference sign-up <{{unconf.url}}>`__ to see if there are any sessions you are interested in joining. New ones are added all the time, so check back periodically.

{% endif %}
- The session leader will begin when the group has gathered.

Lightning talks
---------------

- A Lightning Talk is a five-minute talk where you quickly share a concept or bit of info you find interesting. Lightning talks are a great way to practice public speaking, get people excited about your Unconference session, and test interest in a conference proposal idea.
- If you are interested in giving a lightning talk, be prepared! There is a great guide `here <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/lightning-talks/?highlight=re>`__.
- Watch the conference chat and **Reception** for an announcement that Lightning Talk sign-ups have opened and for directions on how to sign up.
- If you are selected to speak, one of the Organisers will contact you with more information.

Job Fair
--------

- The Job Fair takes place on Tuesday morning. Each company attending the Job Fair will have their own Session table. To view the Job Fair participants and booths, go to **Expo**.
- Once you are in the session, check out the pinned message to review job and company information.
- If you want to start a conversation with someone at the session, go to the **Chat** tab, make sure the **Expo** toggle is on, and ask your question. You can set up 1:1 conversations using chat or video, too.
- Remember, there might be multiple people starting conversations, so there could be a wait.

Sponsor booths
--------------

Select **Expo** to view Sponsor booths. Sponsors might have videos you can watch, information to review on the **Booth** tab, and people you can talk to on the **Chat** tab. Visiting Sponsor booths is a great way to make connections!

Networking
----------

Add info to your profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add information about yourself to your conference profile, select your initials > **Edit Profile**. Share as much as you are comfortable.

Important: Any info you add to your profile can be seen by everyone attending the conference. All conversations should adhere to the `Write the Docs Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__.

Reach out to attendees

- When you attend a Session, view the main Stage, or visit an Expo booth, you’ll see a toggle for switching between conference-wide chat and event chat. When you select **Event**, you are chatting the entire conference. To chat just your session, toggle on the **Session** or **Booth** chat.

Hallway sessions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under **Sessions** you'll find one or more hallway sessions, for casually talking with other attendees.
You can join with your own audio and video, or chat only.

Here’s some icebreakers:

- What are you reading for fun right now?
- Have you found a website that makes you happy during social isolation?
- If you could start a business, what would it be?
- What is the best vacation you’ve ever been on?
- Are you working on any passion projects right now?
- What are your favorite podcasts?
- What is the most surprising thing that happened to you in the past week?
- What drew you to your work?

Small group video chats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- When you Direct message Chat another attendee, you’ll see a button for starting 1:1 video chat.
- You can start a 1:1 video chat with one person and then send the link to up to two other people, to start a 4-person video chat.
- This is a great way to continue a conversation that started in an Unconference or Hallway session.

Monday night social
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Monday Night Social is a chance to chat informally with other conference attendees. This year, the Monday Night Social will be held from 5:00 to 7:00 pm PST in Spatial Chat. Look for a link from the conference organizers at the conference on Monday. Spatial chat works just like real conversations, except in a virtual room.

- Once you enter the spatial chat, you'll see a bubble with your video or name in it.
- You can use the icons along the bottom to turn on or off your video or audio.
- There will be several rooms to find people in. Look in the menu on the right-hand side and double-click on a room to enter it.
- Once you are in a room, drag your bubble towards people to chat with them. The closer you are to other people, the better you can hear them.
- If you want to chat with someone specific, find their name in the left-hand side menu and double-click to be taken to where they are in the virtual room.
- Remember to follow the Pac Man rule and leave a space open in your group conversations for new people to join.

This is new to everyone this year, so experiment and have fun! There is no wrong way to do this!
