CFP Reminder & Ticket Sales Open
################################

Happy New Year, fellow documentarians!

Now that we've crossed the threshold into 2018, the Portland Write the Docs conference is suddenly feeling *much* closer! Our `call for proposals closes next Wednesday <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/cfp/>`_, and `tickets for the conference are officially on sale <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/tickets/>`_. Read on for more details on both!

Submit your talk by Wednesday
------------------------------------------------------------

With the deadline for submissions coming up on **Wednesday, January 10th at midnight PST**, there's just a few days left to `propose a talk <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/cfp/#submit-your-proposal>`_ for Write the Docs Portland!

If you're interested or already working on pitching a talk, make sure you review the full `call for proposals <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/cfp/>`_. And if you've already got an idea, but you’re having a hard time getting your proposal to come together, you can always ask for feedback on the `WTD Slack <http://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`_. The community is there to help!

As always, we're eagerly looking forward to `your submissions <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/cfp/#submit-your-proposal>`_! We’ll be reviewing all the talk proposals later this month, and announcing the full conference schedule in February.


Get your ticket for the conference
------------------------------------------------------------

**The Portland conference will be returning to the Crystal Ballroom on May 6-8, 2018.** The `event website <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/>`_ is up, with some preliminary details, and we'll be filling in more, as it gets closer. We're already excited to see what this year has in store!

If you're excited too, it might interest you to know that `ticket sales are now live <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/>`_! For the last several years the conference has sold out, so it doesn't hurt to buy early.

We'd like to thank **Google** for coming on board as our first big sponsor for the conference. If your company would be interested in sponsoring, check out `our prospectus for details on the different packages <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/sponsors/prospectus/>`_ and drop us a line at `sponsorship@writethedocs.org <mailto:sponsorship@writethedocs.org>`_

One small change to make note of – we're switching up conference swag this year! Instead of our traditional t-shirts, your ticket will include a fresh new rendition of branded WTD swag. Stay tuned for more details!

Looking forward to seeing y'all in Portland!

The Write the Docs Team
