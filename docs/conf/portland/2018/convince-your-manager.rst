  SUBJECT: Professional Development: Documentation Community Conference

  I'd like to attend Write the Docs in Portland, 6-8 May 2018. This three-day event explores the art and science of documentation, and covers a diverse range of topics related to documentation in the software industry.

  Write the Docs conferences bring together everyone who writes the docs – Tech Writers, Developers, Developer Relations, Customer Support – making the events an ideal networking opportunity.
  Each conference successfully combines a number of different event formats to deliver engaging, practical, and timely content.

  There is a single track of talks, a parallel unconference event, and a community writing day. The `sessions from 2017 <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/speakers/>`_ will give you a good idea of the kinds of topics covered, many of which are relevant to my work.

  Costs:

  * Conference ticket (includes breakfast and lunch) - $450
  * Travel – [fill in with estimate]
  * Accommodation – – [fill in with estimate]

  Benefits:

  * Discovering solutions to problems I'm facing at work
  * Exposure to the latest ideas, techniques, and tools for software docs
  * Opportunity to learn from the best doc teams in the industry
  * Building professional connections with other documentarians

  Thanks in advance,
  [your name]

Resources
---------

When discussing how to pitch the conference, a few generally helpful tips emerged:

* Highlight a few specific talks that relate to ongoing projects at work. (This one's dependent on pitching after the talk line up has been announced).
* If your company is looking to hire another documentarian, the job fair and networking at the event are an excellent resource.
* Don't forget that one of the benefits to your attendance is that it raises the visibility of your company in the community. If your team wants a reputation for caring about their docs, having people at Write the Docs is a great way to do that.

In addition, it can be useful to share some info about previous conferences. You can find the websites for previous events on :doc:`/conf/index/`, and a quick list of last year's talks down below.
But perhaps more useful might be some of the info in our :doc:`press-kit/`, which includes community testimonials, photos, and more.

Testimonials

"Thanks to the extensive knowledge and support of the WTD community, I was able to get to the next level in my career (hello, Senior title!) and make more valuable contributions to my company. The big one was overhauling our documentation process, which is now simple, powerful, and open to anyone. It's greatly increased my productivity and the quality and accuracy of our documentation. I'm excited and proud to be part of such an awesome community." -Erin Cochran, Senior Technical Documentation Manager at Stitch
