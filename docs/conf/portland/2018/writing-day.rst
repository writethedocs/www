Write Write the Docs on Writing Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This year we're also running a session where you can help improve your favorite
website. Yup, you can brainstorm improvements, write helpful content and posts,
or just magically improve `Write the Docs <http://www.writethedocs.org>`_.

If you're writing text to add to the website, ideally you'll already be familiar
with GitHub and writing in plain text (markdown or restructured text), but we'll
be there to help out if you're not.

If you'd rather brainstorm a content reorganization in Google Docs, improve our
python scripts or our jinja templates we've got plenty to do there as well.

Here are a few things we'll be working on on writing day, reach out to
`@plaindocs <https://twitter.com/plaindocs>`_ if you have any questions or more
suggestions.

Brainstorm user oriented architecture
=======================================

The website is currently organised around meetups, conferences, guides, etc –
find ways to introduce user-oriented labels considering audience. Who is coming
to the site, why? What are the goals of the site?

- Learn about docs
- Get involved with the community
- Attend conference
- Submit a conference proposal
- Find a video of a talk that I saw

Improve navigation
===================

Let's discuss information architecture -- can we organize the content better?
Provide better navigation?

Write articles for the newsletter
====================================

Summarize content from the Slack channel for the `newsletter </blog/newsletter-may-2018/#looking-ahead>`_.

Help develop the Documentation Guide
===========================================

Help reorganize the guide content, or write and edit topics. Check out
:doc:`/guide/index/` ahead of time and bring your ideas to the table!"

Fix website issues
===================

We have a list of `issues on GitHub
<https://github.com/writethedocs/www/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Awritingday>`_
tagged as `writingday` that includes things like

- fix broken links (we have a lot of these)
- improve the meetup pages
- make a better video archive
- add list of conference write ups for past conferences
