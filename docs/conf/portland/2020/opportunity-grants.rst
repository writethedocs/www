Opportunity grants
==================

The grant program for WTD Portland 2020 supports people who would otherwise not be able to attend the conference by covering attendance costs. Applications are open to anyone who wants to attend Write the Docs.

To apply, fill in the form below. As the conference is virtual this year, the grant offers you a single free ticket to the conference. If you have already applied for the original grant program, please submit an application again, because the dates have changed and not everyone may be available.

Depending on the number of applications, we may not be able to provide every applicant with a free ticket. We prioritize applications based on the overall impact that granting an application will have on the applicant, the Write the Docs community, and the applicant's wider community and country, compared to others.

Grant applicants, like all other participants in the Write the Documents community, are required to conform to the Code of Conduct: https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/.

**Grant applications are open until July 1st, 2020, Midnight PST.**
