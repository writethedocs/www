Job Fair
========

Connecting people with potential employers has always been a core benefit of attending Write the Docs, so we're excited to introduce some more structure to that connection.

Documentarians looking for jobs will be able to talk to employers to learn about the company culture, ask about specific job openings, and talk to current employees.

If you're an employer looking to fill a role, you can find information about :doc:`reservingjob fair spot <sponsors/prospectus/>` in the sponsorship prospectus.
