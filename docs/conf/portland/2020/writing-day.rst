The Good Docs Project
---------------------

 `The Good Docs Project <https://thegooddocsproject.dev>`_  is collating best practices for creating great docs. At Write the Docs Portland we'll be focusing on four key topics:

**Templates**

You've just been asked by your team to create documentation for your project. But what kind of document should you create? (An FAQ? A README?) What is supposed to be in it? How do you begin?

 `The Good Docs Project's templates <https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/templates>`_ can help.

We're working on a set of templates to make it easier to write documentation by suggesting the content needed to create the minimum viable set of documentation for your project. Drop by if you have new documentation to create, or if you want to try your existing docs against our checklists, or if you just want to talk about templates.

Reach out to @ccromwell on WTD slack if interested.

**How would you customize a style guide?**

We have a draft `Style guide template <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HxtaiayAJZvF0ZfNjLvRH3vYMvGTEki_TK8hFilQNJ0>`_ and would love feedback from tech writers. (Please use comments rather than track changes in the doc - it is easier to maintain.)

Reach out to @alyssa on WTD slack if interested.

**Transform templates to your wiki format**

We want to be able to convert our markdown templates to your format? What tools, configuration settings, and how-tos should we have for this?

Reach out to @ScriptAutomate on WTD slack if interested.

**What should a glossary or word list look like?**

We are kicking off a pilot to define best practices for `cross-domain management of glossaries <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fjrl34ErnYammel9WmvXJ3rMWFANjoSiiGyyNSYOXUg/>`_. We want help defining what an ideal glossary entry or preferred word list entry should look like. Work will happen in this `glossary entry <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wsSLQ_T8skVdlvjF5ayZa5IhKbTazdqm97lHX0qc16Q>`_ page.

Reach out to @alyssa and @cameronshorter on WTD slack if interested. (@cameronshorter is in the Australian timezone.)

**General chit-chat**

We hang out in `thegooddocs.slack.com <https://join.slack.com/t/thegooddocs/shared_invite/enQtODkyNjI5MDc0NjE0LTUyNGFiZmU1MjIzNDMwN2E3NmQwODQwZmRkYWI5MDhlMzdjYzg4Nzg4YjM3ODA0NGE4MTgyYzdkMGViMTI2MDM>`_.

Write the Docs Meetups
----------------------

Organizing local Write the Docs meetup communities is a rewarding way to participate. During Writing Day, we'll have a table where we can share tips and best practices, espcially in this time where all of our meetups are virtual.

GitLab - Meet the Docs Team and Contribute to the Docs
------------------------------------------------------

`GitLab <https://about.gitlab.com>`_ is an open core single application for
the entire software development lifecycle. It covers everything from project
planning and source code management to CI/CD, monitoring, and security.

Our `documentation <https://docs.gitlab.com>`_ is open source and everybody can
contribute to it. All the content is hosted on GitLab.com, so you will need a
`GitLab.com account <https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up>`_.

For more information, see our `GitLab issue <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/technical-writing/-/issues/217>`_.

Once you find the issue you want to work on:

#. Add a comment mentioning `@gl-docsteam` to inform us that you’re working on this for Writing Day (and tell us in person!).
#. Create a merge request with your proposed changes.

Once your merge request is reviewed and merged, it will appear on the docs site
shortly!

If you have any questions, you can reach to us in person or in Slack: `@amyq`, `@arty-chan`, `@mikejang`, `@miketechnically`, `@selhorn`, `@Ray Paik`.

MDN Web Docs
------------
`MDN Web Docs <https://developer.mozilla.org>`_ is a source of references, guides, and tutorials on standards-based web technologies, much loved by web developers. It was chosen as #1 for Documentation in the Developer’s Choice Awards for 2018, conducted by SlashData.

Yet, MDN Web Docs needs help from documentarians—whether you are a programmer, web designer, or someone else who cares about web technology. MDN is a wiki, so anyone can contribute to content. You can use your Google or GitHub credentials to create a wiki account. 

We have `tasks for you to help with content issues and editorial reviews <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q6BiE1-RJPFoe2IAghqhRbm0vci24k2nBLqdd_Dqn7o/edit?usp=sharing>`_.

Look for `@jmswisher` in the WTD slack for help and questions.
