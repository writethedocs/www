Your Project Here
-----------------

The Good Docs Project
---------------------

You've just been asked by your team to create documentation for your project. But what kind of document should you create? (An FAQ? A README?) What is supposed to be in it? How do you begin?

 `The Good Docs Project <https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/templates>`_ can help.

We're working on a set of templates to make it easier to write documentation by suggesting the content needed to create the minimum viable set of documentation for your project. Visit our table if you have new documentation to create, or if you want to try your existing docs against our checklists, or if you just want to talk about templates.

Write The Docs Meetups
----------------------

Organizing local Write The Docs meetup communities is a rewarding way to participate. During Writing Day, we'll have a table where we can share tips and best practices, espcially in this time where all of our meetups are virtual.

GitLab - Meet the Docs Team and Contribute to the Docs
------------------------------------------------------

`GitLab <https://about.gitlab.com>`_ is an open core single application for
the entire software development lifecycle. From project planning and source code
management to CI/CD, monitoring, and security.

Our `documentation <https://docs.gitlab.com>`_ is open source and everybody can
contribute to it. All the content is hosted on GitLab.com, so you will need a
`GitLab.com account <https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up>`_.

For more information, see our `GitLab issue <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/technical-writing/-/issues/217>`.

Once you find the issue you want to work on, add a comment mentioning `@gl-docsteam` to inform us that you’re working on
   this for Writing Day (and tell us in person!).
#. Create a merge request with your proposed changes.

Once your merge request is reviewed and merged, it will appear on the docs site
shortly!

If you have any questions, you can reach to us in person or in Slack: `@amyq`, `@arty-chan`, `@mikejang`, `@miketechnically`.
