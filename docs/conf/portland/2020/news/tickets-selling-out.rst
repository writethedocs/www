Tickets Selling Out Soon and Welcome Wagon Guide
================================================

Hey everyone!

We're just over a week away from the start of the conference,
and we're getting excited to invite you into our online venue for 3 days of content, collaboration, and conversation.
Tickets are going to sell out in the next couple of days,
so if you've been on the fence,
now is the time to buy one!

We have done our internal testing of the platform,
and we're getting everything ready for prime time.
As part of our internal testing,
we've built out the Welcome Wagon Guide.
This guide is our attempt to make sure that you get the most out of our events,
and we've totally rewritten it for our online event.

Welcome Wagon Guide
-------------------

Each year we create a guide to help our attendees get the most out of the conference.
This year,
we're all first-timers at an online event,
so we've totally rewritten `our Welcome Wagon guide <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/welcome-wagon/>`_ to help you get the most out of our event this year.

We have a lot of information about how to use Hopin,
and lots of tips and tricks for the best way to plan your days.
We've taken all the transit and travel information out,
but please do plan to spend a large part of your day with us from the comfort of your own home.

Tickets will sell out soon
--------------------------

We wanted to let you know that we expect tickets to sell out by **August 4th**.
We've increased the capacity for this years event past the 500 from previous years,
but we still want to make sure the event keeps its managable size and feel.
If you were hoping to come to this years event,
we recommend that you `get your tickets soon <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/tickets/>`_.

Once we sell out our tickets,
we plan to send everyone a link to access the Hopin event.
We plan to send this out mid next week,
to give everyone a few days to work through any troubleshooting issues that you might encounter. The Hopin access links will be sent to all Ti.to ticketholders, so monitor your inbox next week for a message. If you don't get an email from us by the end of next week, please email us and we'll help you out!
Once you've got your Hopin ticket,
you will be ready to get started on Sunday morning with the Writing Day!

Thanks so much to all our sponsors
----------------------------------

We are so grateful to have our sponsors help in bringing these events to life every year. 
You'll be able to chat with most of our sponsors at the Job Fair,
and a few will have booths for conversations the entire conference.

Thanks so much to the following companies for supporting the Portland conference this year:
