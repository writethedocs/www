Announcing ticket sales for the Portland virtual conference
===========================================================

We're excited to announce that tickets are on sale for our Portland virtual conference.
More details will be coming soon,
but we're enthusiastic about the accessibility benefits of the new format,
and can't wait to try out a few new ideas this year.

Get your ticket for the conference
----------------------------------

**The Portland conference will be held online on {{ date.short }}.** The `full event website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/>`_ is live, with some preliminary details, and we'll be filling in more as it gets closer.

If you're excited too, go ahead and `register for your ticket now <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/tickets/>`_! We aren't sure exactly what capacity we will be able to hold for the virtual event, but we might still sell out to make sure we're providing a managable event size for our attendees, as always.

We're still working out all the details for our virtual event,
but know that we're going to keep as much as possible of the spirit of the event alive:

* Excellent single track of presentations -- now with moderated Q&A at the end!
* Writing Day
* Unconference sessions
* Job Fair
* Sponsor booths
* A virtual hallway track
* A social event of some kind, bring your own beverage and snacks :)
  
We really want to make sure that folks can get value from being at the event at the same time,
and we think it will be another great year of helping our community connect.

Grant program
-------------

We updated our grant program application to take into account the virtual format of the event.
We're excited to be able to offer free tickets to a larger number of people this year,
since there are now minimal other costs to attend the event.

You can apply by **June 5th, 2020, Midnight PST** on `our website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/opportunity-grants/>`_.

**Update**: the grant program application deadline has moved to July 1st, 2020.

Support our community by sponsoring
-----------------------------------

Every year we are fortunate to have the support of like-minded organizations and communities, who believe in the collaborative and welcoming community spirit and help us make our events great.

We have drafted a new `virtual sponsorship prospectus`_ for the conference,
and are open for new sponsorship inquiries.
