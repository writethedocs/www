Welcome Wagon Guide
===================

Hello!

We’re your Welcome Wagon, and we’re glad you’re attending Write the
Docs! We realize a virtual conference might be totally new to you (us,
too!). This guide will help you navigate it, even if you’ve been to a
Write the Docs conference before.

We are all first-timers at this year’s virtual conference. The Welcome
Wagon is here for you, to help you make the most of it. We’d love to
virtually meet you: feel free to reach out in Chat at the virtual
conference or `email <mailto:canncrochet@gmail.com>`__ us if we can help
make your time at the conference easier.

Reception: Your home base
-------------------------

Once you enter the virtual conference, you’ll be at **Reception**. You
can view Reception as your home base for the conference. There’s a
schedule, a list of events happening now, and helpful reminders about
what you can do at the conference.

Don’t be afraid to explore! You won’t interrupt anything by looking
around.

Conference talks and Q&A
------------------------

- There’s a talk schedule on the **Reception** page and on the `Write the Docs website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/schedule/>`__. Select the Calendar icon next to the talks you want to see on the Reception page to add them to your calendar.
- When it’s time for a talk you want to see, select **Stage**.
- If we have problems with our online platform, go to the `Write the Docs website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/backup-livestream/>`__ for a back-up stream. This will only be turned on if we have technical issues.
- After a talk, feel free to tweet about it with the hashtag #writethedocs.
- There is a lot of great information at this conference, but don’t worry if you miss something! All talks are recorded and videos will be published shortly after the conference, so you can review them later.

Asking questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stick around the **Stage** after each talk for a 10-minute, moderated Q&A.

- Enter your questions into the **Chat** channel (always on the right-hand side of any page) prefixed with “Q:“, and the moderator will ask the speaker for you.
- Make sure the **Stage** toggle is on for the Chat, so your question will be seen by the moderator.
- Due to time constraints, we might not be able to get to all of your questions. If your question isn’t asked live, chat with the speaker later and make a connection!

Participate in the conference
-----------------------------

The schedule is built around **sessions**. Almost all of the in-person interactions you’ll have at the virtual conference will be through sessions. Learn how to find and participate in sessions, and use these lessons for attending Writing Day, Unconference, Job Fair, and Monday night Social events.

Finding events to participate in
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can view the schedule on the **Reception** page. You can also browse a list of events by selecting **Sessions**.
- When you select an event in the schedule, like a Writing Day or Unconference session, you are directed to the **Sessions** page.
- Once you are on the **Sessions** page, select the session you want to attend.

Joining an event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Once you select a session, you can either view the session and use the Chat, or select **Share Audio and Video** to participate in the session. Sessions are limited to 20 active participants, but anyone can join and view the session.

Writing Day
-----------

`Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/writing-day/>`__ takes place on Sunday, the day before the conference starts. You can join in anytime between 9:30am and 5pm PDT.

You can bring a writing project you want to work on, or you can contribute to a project someone else brought.

- **Bring a project**: If you want help with your project, `sign up <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPAXim5gkPmwhANJwngWcg1d09KHqOj3vILn5Tc5V9A/edit?usp=sharing>`__ before Writing Day. When you are ready to start your project on Writing Day, go to **Sessions**, select your table, and start collaborating.

- Here’s the `2019 Writing Day Project list that you can use as a guide <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/writing-day/>`__.

Unconference
------------

- The Unconference is a set of informal sessions that take place all day Monday and Tuesday afternoon. `Unconference talks focus on conversations and exchanges of ideas between participants. <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/unconference/>`__
- You can attend unconference sessions, or, if you have an idea for a session, you can lead one. Anyone can lead an unconference session, as long as they have a discussion idea and a willingness to encourage attendees to talk about it.

To lead an unconference session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Look for an empty slot on the `Unconference sign-up <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPAXim5gkPmwhANJwngWcg1d09KHqOj3vILn5Tc5V9A/edit?usp=sharing>`__, and add your Unconference topic. There will be a time and a table number for each slot.
- When it’s time for your Unconference session to begin, go to **Sessions** and select the session that corresponds to your table number.
- The previous unconference session will be in the same table. Let the attendees of the previous session know that their time is up, and your session will begin soon.
- Once a group has entered your session, start the conversation!
- When the Unconference leader for the next session enters the session, finish up your discussion to make way for the next one.

To join in an unconference session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Starting Monday morning, check the `Unconference schedule <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPAXim5gkPmwhANJwngWcg1d09KHqOj3vILn5Tc5V9A/edit#gid=1493675134>`__ to see if there are any sessions you are interested in joining. New ones are added all the time, so check back periodically.
- At the time the session starts, go to **Sessions** and select the session with the table number that corresponds to the one in the `Unconference schedule <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPAXim5gkPmwhANJwngWcg1d09KHqOj3vILn5Tc5V9A/edit#gid=1493675134>`__.
- The session leader will begin when the group has gathered.

Lightning talks
---------------

- A Lightning Talk is a five-minute talk where you quickly share a concept or bit of info you find interesting. Lightning talks are a great way to practice public speaking, get people excited about your Unconference session, and test interest in a conference proposal idea.
- If you are interested in giving a lightning talk, be prepared! There is a great guide `here <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/lightning-talks/?highlight=re>`__.
- Watch the conference chat and **Reception** for an announcement that Lightning Talk sign-ups have opened and for directions on how to sign up.
- If you are selected to speak, one of the Organisers will contact you with more information.

Job Fair
--------

- The Job Fair takes place on Tuesday morning. Each company attending the Job Fair will have their own Session table. To view the Job Fair participants and booths, go to **Sessions**.
- Once you are in the session, check out the pinned message to review job and company information.
- If you want to start a conversation with someone at the session, go to the **Chat** tab, make sure the **Session** toggle is on, and ask your question. You can set up 1:1 conversations using chat or video, too.
- Remember, there might be multiple people starting conversations, so there could be a wait.

Sponsor booths
--------------

Select **Expo** to view Sponsor booths. Sponsors might have videos you can watch, information to review on the **Booth** tab, and people you can talk to on the **Chat** tab. Visiting Sponsor booths is a great way to make connections!

Monday Social
-------------

The Monday night Social will be designed by you this year! You can host a session and meet fellow attendees for a video social event or you can attend a social event set up by someone else.

Attend a social event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check the `list of social events <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPAXim5gkPmwhANJwngWcg1d09KHqOj3vILn5Tc5V9A/edit#gid=1493675134>`__\ **,** and then go to the **Sessions** page and select the table that you want to join.

Host a social event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have an idea for a social event, find an empty table in the `sign-up sheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HPAXim5gkPmwhANJwngWcg1d09KHqOj3vILn5Tc5V9A/edit#gid=1493675134>`__ and add your session. Here’s some ideas:

- Online game night
- WFH life meetup – give attendees a video tour of your space
- Music performance
- YouTube karaoke
- Silly hats/furry friends meetup

Networking
----------

Add info to your profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add information about yourself to your conference profile, select your initials > **Edit Profile**. Share as much as you are comfortable.

Important: Any info you add to your profile can be seen by everyone attending the conference. All conversations should adhere to the `Write the Docs Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__.

Reach out to attendees
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways to network using the virtual conference platform:

Networking
^^^^^^^^^^

Select **Networking** to be randomly matched with another attendee. Conversations are limited to 1-5 minutes, and you’ll automatically be connected to the next person when your 5 minutes is up. Here’s some icebreakers:

  - What are you reading for fun right now?
  - Have you found a website that makes you happy during social isolation?
  - If you could start a business, what would it be?
  - What is the best vacation you’ve ever been on?
  - Are you working on any passion projects right now?
  - What are your favorite podcasts?
  - What is the most surprising thing that happened to you in the past week?
  - What drew you to your work?

Direct message Chat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  - You can direct message attendees by finding them on the **People** tab.
  - To filter for Organisers or Speakers, select the **Filter** icon.
  - You can toggle between viewing **People** (a list of attendees) and **Messages** (a list of the messages you sent and received).

Event and conference-wide Chat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  - When you chat on any of the main pages (Reception, Sessions, Networking, and Expo, you are chatting *the entire conference*.
  - When you attend a Session, view the main Stage, or visit an Expo booth, you’ll see a toggle for switching between conference-wide chat and event chat. When you select **Event**, you are chatting the entire conference. To chat just your session, toggle on the **Session** or **Booth** chat.

Pro Tips
--------

- Conferences are exhilarating, but can also be exhausting. Give your brain a break! Grab a quiet spot or take a quick walk. Play a board game on your lunch break. Come back invigorated.

- Find out who is attending the conference before you attend. Join the `Write the Docs Slack <http://slack.writethedocs.org/>`__, follow the `Write the Docs on Twitter <https://twitter.com/writethedocs>`__, and review the `list of speakers <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2020/speakers/>`__.

- In case of technical issues with our main platform Hopin, please watch the #wtd-conference Slack channel for status updates and alternative viewing links that might be posted.
