Conference will be only virtual
===============================

We won't bury the lede on the announcement today:

   The Portland 2022 conference held on May 23-25 will be fully virtual.

We make this decision with the understanding that it will disappoint some of you.
We also make this decision with the knowledge that it will relieve some of you from anxiety.
I will explain a bit more below the reasoning for this decision,
but the high-level reasons are:

* **After talking with our vendors and staff, we determined we couldn't produce the quality of event that our attendees expect, while doing a hybrid event.**
* Omicron has changed the risk profile associated with travel & large gatherings, and increased the number of unknown risks that we face as organizers.

We are excited about the quality of our previous virtual events,
and look forward to iterating and improving our event once again this year.
We are just as excited to be able to gather safely as you are,
but we feel the need to hold off for one more year.

We're also looking at the ability for some of our meetups to host watch parties.
The details are still being worked out,
but we'd love to find a way for small groups of people to gather in this fashion.

Updated conference details
--------------------------

Our 2022 conference will be structured the same to our previous virtual events:

* Sunday, May 21: Writing Day
* Monday, May 22: Conference talks, Lightning Talks, Unconference, Social event
* Tuesday, May 23: Conference talks, Job Fair, Lightning Talks, Unconference

We're excited to experiment and improve on our existing format as well.
One change we're considering is doing scheduled Q&A blocks with 2 speakers,
so attendees don't feel rushed going from the main stage to the Q&A from a talk.

Reasons for going virtual
-------------------------

I'd like to focus on four major areas where our decision was based:

* Physical Health
* Event success
* Mental Health
* Organizational Health

The biggest worry that we have when orgnizing the conference is a COVID outbreak.
We were already planning a number of mitigations,
but this risk is always present whenever we gather in a large group.
Omicron has lead to the highest case counts in the USA,
and increased our anxiety about possible negative outcomes.

The quality of the event was another large factor in our decision.
We discussed at length,
but we couldn't find a good way to integrate in-person and virtual attendees.
We figured out a way to handle it for talks,
but things like the job fair, and unconference don't lend themselves to mixing between in-person and virtual.
The biggest requirement to do this effectively is realiable in-person WiFi,
which has *always* proven to be difficult in the past.
We think it is perhaps possible to integrate the two spaces well in the future,
but we weren't able to commit to it this year.

Once we started planning the event,
we realized that our hybrid event would require much more staff.
We'd effectively be running two conferences at once,
and each organizer would be able to focus on one event at a time.
This alone would stretch our existing team to the limit,
without adding the stress of COVID-related disruptions or sickness on top.

The other major consideration is the health of Write the Docs.
Reserving a venue and committing to an in-person event adds a large amount of financial risk to the organization.
We are unsure of what attendence or sposnorship for the in-person event would look like,
and having to cancel the event would be quite a hit to the organization.

Once we thought more deeply about our options to move forward,
moving the event to virtual for this year seemed like the most prudent course of action.
We know that we can produce a great event for our attendees,
and now we don't have to worry nearly as much about COVID-related risks.
