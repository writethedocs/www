Conference highlights and thanks for attending!
===============================================

Hey everyone,

Our team is now emerging from the post-conference
recovery period, and we wanted to send out a quick message to thank
everyone for helping to make our conference such a
success. We appreciate everyone who makes the conference possible:
speakers, sponsors, organizers, and attendees alike!

Conference recap
----------------

At **650 attendees** this conference was another smashing success!
We had the usual mix of talks on the main stage along with Q&A,
lightning talks, unconference sessions,
writing sprints, social event, and job fair.
We thought everything went pretty smoothly this year;
we're getting pretty good at virtual events!

Talk videos
-----------

`Videos of the talks`_ are now available on YouTube. This
includes all conference talks and Q&A, as well as the lightning talks.
You can also subscribe to our `YouTube channel`_ so you don’t miss any future content.

Thanks again to all our presenters, moderator, and folks who asked wonderful questions!
Huge thanks also to `Bart at Work`_ for handling the A/V production on
our event, it was flawless once again this year.

Come see us at our Prague or Australia & India conferences
----------------------------------------------------------

Don’t forget our `Prague conference`_ on **September 11-13**, and our
`Australia conference`_ on **Dec 8-9**. The CFP is open for Prague, and
Australia will be open soon.

We’re also looking for more sponsors to make our other events just as
magical as this year’s Portland event. You can see all our `sponsorship options`_ on our website.

Write the Docs Slack
--------------------

Our Slack network has really grown more this last year. Our #general
Slack channel has been extra busy in the days and weeks leading up to
the conference, and we hope that y’all continue the conversations
throughout the year. If you haven’t joined, now is the time! Check out
the `Write the Docs Slack`_.

Write the Docs Newsletter
-------------------------

Our `monthly newsletter`_ is the other place to keep track of everything
that is happening with the community. Subscribe to make sure you hear
about all the conferences, meetups, job postings, and summaries of
relevant conversations in our Slack.

Local Meetups
-------------

We hope you continue to `build the meetup community`_ and keep in touch
with other documentarians near your hometown. We have a number of
meetups in cities across the country, and if you don’t see your city
listed consider `starting`_ a meetup!

New this year are our `Quorum Meetups`_ which are virtual and targeting
large geographic areas. There’s already one covering most everyone in
the US or in a similar timezone.

Code of Conduct transparency report
-----------------------------------

As with any Write the Docs event,
this conference was covered by our `community Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__.
We aim to be as transparent with CoC incidents and enforcement as we can.

To ensure that our CoC was visible and accessible, we took a number of specific steps:

- Every participant agreed to the Code of Conduct in advance during registration.
- The CoC, or a summary, was included on the conference website and Hopin Reception
- The CoC was repeatedly mentioned in our conference introduction and announcements.
- We specifically stressed that the CoC applies to all conference spaces including the social event.
- We encouraged all attendees to report any incident, even if they were not sure whether it was a violation.

None of our organizers were approached about any CoC concerns at this event.
We know that this is, in part, a reflection of the thoughtful and inclusive community that we're so lucky to have.

That being said, we're also very conscious of the fact that just because
nothing was reported doesn't mean nothing happened. If there was any personal
conduct or other aspect of the conference experience that did not meet the
expectations of behavior set out in the CoC, please email us at
`conduct@writethedocs.org <mailto:conduct@writethedocs.org>`_.

Thanks again

this time or not, we hope to see you again next year – or
even sooner at one of our other events!
