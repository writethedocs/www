Announcing Write the Docs Portland {{year}}
===========================================

Welcome to the official launch of `Write the Docs Portland {{year}} <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/>`_,
our fourth virtual conference.
We have been tuning our approach to these events since our first virtual event in August,
and are happy to invite you back to our online space.

We're excited to announce the dates for our next conference:
**Write the Docs Portland 2021 will be on April 25-27, 2021**

It's been a rough year for a lot of us,
and we are still putting the finishing touches on the event this year.
We plan to have more details during the next few weeks,
but there's a few more detailed updates below.

Call for Proposals
------------------

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

We plan to launch our CFP in early December and have it last until sometime in January.
Get started coming up with ideas for the conference now.

Tickets
-------

Tickets will officially go on sale in **January {{ year }}**.
We will announce ticket prices soon,
so that you can start planning your budget.
As with the previous years, we have tiered pricing to make it fair for everyone.

As always, we keep ticket prices low so that it is accessible to the widest range of people possible.
However, if you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend,
we will bringing our Opportunity Grants program back again this year.

Sponsorship

We are planning to do similar sponsorship levels again this year as last year.
In addition to the regular sponsorship levels, we are working on additional ways to sponsor our online events.
In the meantime,
