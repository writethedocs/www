Announcing Write the Docs {{ city }} {{year}}
===========================================

Welcome to the official launch of `Write the Docs Portland {{year}} <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/>`_.
We're excited to announce the dates for our next conference:
**Write the Docs {{ city }} {{ year }} will be on {{ date.short }}**

We are planning to do a **hybrid event** this year,
which means the in-person part of the conference will be returning.
We are still in the planning phases for how to handle this safely,
and would love your `feedback <mailto:portland@writethedocs.org>`_ on how we should progress.

.. TODO: Add link to survey?

It's been a rough year for a lot of us,
but we're hoping that late next spring things will be looking a lot safer for us to gather.
We plan to release more details during the next few weeks,
but there's a few specific updates below.

Health Guidelines
-----------------

We will continue to monitor the health guidelines for Portland & Oregon as the conference approaches,
but our current plan is to have the following rules in place:

* Vaccination required for all attendees
* Masks required for all indoor spaces
* A new venue that provides more access to outside air, and outdoor space
* 100% refund for all attendees who need to cancel for COVID-related reasons
* Limited venue capacity to give people enough room to socially distance
* Seating options based on comfort level being near others in various spaces
* Venue spaces with windows that open or that are fully outside

We also have a few more ideas to ensure safety of all attendees that we are discussing,
and will have more information as the event comes closer.

Call for Proposals
------------------

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

We plan to launch our CFP in January and have it last until sometime in February.
We're still working out the exact details for the CFP,
but our current plan is to record all talks so that the experience will be comparable between online and in-person attendees.
We hope this will reduce anxiety for our speakers about feeling the need to attend in person,
or have a second-rate experience presenting remotely.

Get started coming up with ideas for the conference now,
and we'll let you know when the CFP opens.

Tickets
-------

Tickets will go on sale in **{{ date.tickets_live }}**.
We will announce ticket prices soon,
so that you can start planning your budget.
As with the previous years, we have tiered pricing to make it fair for everyone,
and will likely price in-person and virtual tickets separately.

As always, we keep ticket prices low so that it is accessible to the widest range of people possible.
However, if you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend,
we will be running our Opportunity Grants program again this year.

Sponsorship
-----------

We are still thinking about how best to handle sponsorship for a hybrid event,
and will release our prospectus soon.

If you are already excited about sponsoring,
you can always reach out to us now.
We're always open to customization on our sponsorships, especially given the new format.
You can always reach us with ideas or questions at sponsorship@writethedocs.org.
