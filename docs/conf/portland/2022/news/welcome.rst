Announcing Write the Docs {{ city }} {{year}}
===========================================

Welcome to the official launch of `Write the Docs Portland {{year}} <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/>`_.
We're excited to announce the dates for our next conference:
**Write the Docs {{ city }} {{ year }} will be on {{ date.short }}**


We will be running a **hybrid event** this year,
with our online event joining a return to the in-person part of the conference.
We are still in the planning phase for how to handle this safely,
and would love your `feedback <mailto:portland@writethedocs.org>`_ on how we should progress.

It's been a rough year for a lot of us,
but we're hoping that by next spring things will be looking a lot safer for us to gather.
We plan to release more details during the next few weeks,
but there's a few specific updates below.

Health Guidelines
-----------------

We will continue to monitor the health guidelines for Portland & Oregon as the conference approaches,
but our current plan is to have the following rules in place:

* Vaccination required for all attendees
* Masks required in all indoor spaces
* A new venue that provides more access to outside air, and outdoor space
* 100% refund for all attendees who need to cancel for COVID-related reasons
* Limited venue capacity to give people enough room to socially distance
* Seating options based on distancing comfort level in various spaces
* Indoor meeting spaces with open windows (weather permitting)
* Outdoor meeting areas

We are discussing more ideas and processes to ensure safety of all attendees,
and will publish more information as we get closer to the event.

Call for Proposals
------------------

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

We plan to launch our CFP in January for those who are excited to speak.
We're still working out the exact details for the CFP,
but our current plan is to record all talks so that the experience will be comparable between online and in-person,
for attendees and speakers.
We hope that this will help maintain the accessibility level that remote presentations gave us,
and invite speakers who cannot or do not feel comfortable attending in person.

Start thinking about your talk proposal now,
and we'll let you know as soon as the CFP opens.


Tickets
-------

Tickets will go on sale in **{{ date.tickets_live }}**.
We will announce ticket prices soon,
so that you can start planning your budget.
As with the previous years, we have tiered pricing to make it fair for everyone,
and will price in-person and virtual tickets separately.

As always, we keep ticket prices low so that it is accessible to the widest range of people possible.
However, if you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend,
we will be running our Opportunity Grants program again this year.

Sponsorship
-----------

We are still thinking about how best to handle sponsorship for a hybrid event,
and will release our prospectus soon.

If you are already excited about sponsoring, reach out to us at sponsorship@writethedocs.org.
We're open to customization or new ideas for our sponsorships levels, especially given the new format.
