Announcing Write the Docs {{ city }} {{year}}
===========================================

Welcome to the official launch of `Write the Docs Portland {{year}} <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/>`_.
We're excited to announce the dates for our next conference:
**Write the Docs {{ city }} {{ year }} will be on {{ date.short }}**

We are planning to do a **hybrid event** this year,
which means the in-person part of the conference will be returning.
We are still in the planning phases for how to handle this safely,
and would love your `feedback <mailto:portland@writethedocs.org>`_ on how we should progress.
Are you interested in attending in person?

.. TODO: Add link to survey?

It's been a rough year for a lot of us,
and we are still putting the finishing touches on the event this year.
We plan to have more details during the next few weeks,
but there's a few more detailed updates below.

Health Guidelines
-----------------

We will continue to monitor the health guidelines for Portland & Oregon as the conference approaches,
but our current plan is to have the following rules in place:

* Vaccination required for all attendees
* Masks required for all indoor spaces
* Venue capacity of around 50% of the total space, to give people enough room to socially distance
* A new venue that provides much more ready access to outside air, and outdoor space

Call for Proposals
------------------

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

We plan to launch our CFP in January and have it last until sometime in February.
Get started coming up with ideas for the conference now.

Tickets
-------

Tickets will officially go on sale in **{{ date.tickets_live }}**.
We will announce ticket prices soon,
so that you can start planning your budget.
As with the previous years, we have tiered pricing to make it fair for everyone.

As always, we keep ticket prices low so that it is accessible to the widest range of people possible.
However, if you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend,
we will bringing our Opportunity Grants program back again this year.

Sponsorship
-----------

We are still thinking about how best to handle sponsorship for a Hybrid event,
and will release our prospectus soon.

We're always open to customization on our sponsorships, especially given the new online format.
You can always reach us with ideas or questions at sponsorship@writethedocs.org.
