Hike
====

Every year we have a conference hike that kicks off the *unofficial* beginning of the conference. It has become a fantastic tradition and is a wonderful way to gather the day before the conference begins. 

We will be hiking in the amazing `Forest Park <http://www.forestparkconservancy.org/>`__, the largest urban forested park in the country. It is conveniently located in Northwest Portland, and has a beautiful walk along a creek. 

It's rained on us in the past, but we have faith it will be beautiful this year! We will hopefully see Mount Hood at the top :)

What to Bring 
-------------

The temperature will likely be in the upper 50s and 60s, with a chance of rain. There is no predicting Portland Spring weather! Please bring:

- **Comfortable shoes**, that you are willing to get a bit muddy.
- **Water!** There is water available halfway through the hike.
- **Light rain jacket**. It likely will not be too cold, but it might drizzle on you.
- **High spirits!**

The Hike
--------

The hike will be around 5 miles long, and have 1,200 feet of elevation gain. This classifies as a *moderate* hike. We'll be going nice and slow so people can appreciate the views and forest.

We hope you will join us for this pre-conference activity!
