Sponsor Expo
============

Each year we invite our top sponsors to engage with our attendees throughout the conference and during our Sponsor Expo. Sponsors can participate in two ways:

* **Hiring:** Companies that are hiring and can speak with attendees about work and available jobs.
* **Products:** Companies that build products for docs folks, where attendees can learn more about what people are building.

Write the Docs looks forward to facilitating constructive networking, connecting people with jobs and employers, and hearing more from some of our sponsors. 

Schedule
--------

Our sponsors will be available all day Monday & Tuesday.

Exact times are posted on our :doc:`/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/schedule` page.
