Attendee Guide
==============

The Attendee Guide provides conference information and gives strategies
and tips for new (and experienced) attendees to get plugged in and
connect with others! We’ve gathered info here that will help you
navigate the conference like a pro and make you feel more at home.

Where Can I Ask a Question?
---------------------------

The Welcome Wagon Team is available to make your conference experience
better! Stop by the Welcome Wagon table or feel free to ask questions in
the `#welcomewagon Slack
channel <https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`__. Whether you have a
question about the schedule, where to eat, or how to connect with other
attendees, they are your go-to for conference questions. If they don’t
know the answer, they’ll find someone who does!

**Location and Availability:** - Welcome Wagon table is located directly
next to the Registration table - Team will be available during all
conference hours

Welcome Wagon Tours
-------------------

Join us for an introduction to Write the Docs. We’ll go on a short tour
of the venue and review information about the conference. This is
specifically for first-timers and gives everyone a chance to meet
someone new. Bring any questions you may have!

- Sunday AM TBD
- Sunday PM TBD
- Monday AM TBD

*Sunday tours will meet on the 1st floor at the Welcome Wagon table.

Tips to Have a Great Conference
-------------------------------

- Before the conference, join the Write the Docs
   `Slack <https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`__, and follow Write the
   Docs on
   `LinkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/company/18284823/admin/feed/posts/>`__
   and `X, formerly known as
   Twitter <https://twitter.com/writethedocs>`__.
- Attend a Welcome Wagon tour!
- Talk with people - attendees, volunteers, staff, and speakers. Don’t
   forget to use Eric Holscher’s `Pac-Man
   Rule <https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/>`__
   to leave room for others to join! The most important part of this
   conference (and any conference) is the people you meet. Set a goal
   for yourself to meet a few new people.
- Review the speaker schedule and choose which talks you want to attend
   the most. Spread out your time between talks, unconference sessions,
   networking, and breaks.
- Starting Monday morning, check the Unconference schedule to discover
   if there are any sessions you are interested in attending. New
   sessions are added all the time, so check back periodically.
- Give yourself and your brain a break! Conferences are exhilarating,
   but can also be exhausting. Grab a quiet spot in the Sunset Room or
   take a quick walk.
- Eat! There will be snacks available but there are many restaurants
   close by.
- Job searching? Check out the job board and Sponsor Expo.
