# Venue

## Revolution Hall

Our conference will be held at Revolution Hall, a beautiful venue
located on the thriving inner east side of Portland. It was originally a
high school, and converted into the versatile space it is today,
including an 850-seat auditorium, coffee shop, bar/restaurant, rooftop
bar, rooms to support events, and local businesses. It still has some
lockers in the hallway for that extra ambiance.
