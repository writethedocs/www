Venue
=========

Revolution Hall 
--------------------

Our conference will be held at Revolution Hall, a beautiful venue located on the thriving inner east side of Portland. It was originally a high school, and converted into the versatile space it is today, including an 850-seat auditorium, coffee shop, bar/restaurant, rooftop bar, rooms to support events, and local businesses. It still has some lockers in the hallway for that extra ambiance.
