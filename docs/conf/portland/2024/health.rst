No vaccination or testing requirement
-------------------------------------

This year we have removed our vaccination and testing mandate.
We will not be requiring any specific COVID-related health measures to attend the event,
however we will still provide a number of accommodations for people who have concerns.

Masks Provided
--------------

We are not currently requiring that masks be worn at all times in the venue.
We will be providing masks to attendees at our registration desk.

Onsite health and safety measures
---------------------------------

Please expect the following measures to be in place at the event:

* Physically-spaced audience seating in certain areas of the main ballroom
* Event participants are asked to not crowd around booths and to limit the number of attendees at a booth at any given time.
* Wider aisles and increased event traffic flow signage to allow for physical distancing
* Plentiful hand sanitation stations onsite
* Personal hand sanitizer bottles and wipes available for participants
* Antigen COVID tests available at registration, while supplies last
* Masks available at registration, while supplies last

At a minimum, we will also be following all mandated venue and state guidelines.
**This list, and all protocols, are subject to change as the fluid COVID-19 situation changes.
Changes to this policy will only add requirements, and will not remove requirements.**
