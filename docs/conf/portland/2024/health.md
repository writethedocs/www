**This policy is up to date as of October 2023.**

### No Vaccination or Testing Requirement

This year, we have removed our vaccination and testing mandate. We will not be requiring any specific COVID-related health measures to attend the event, however we will still provide a number of accommodations for people who have concerns.

### Masks Provided

We are not currently requiring that masks be worn in the venue. We will provide masks to attendees at our registration desk.

### Onsite health and safety measures

Please expect the following measures to be in place at the event:

* Physically-spaced audience seating on the 3rd level of the main auditorium
* Additional event traffic flow signage to allow for physical distancing
* Plentiful hand sanitation stations onsite
* Personal hand sanitizer and wipes available for participants
* Antigen COVID tests available at registration, while supplies last
* Masks available at registration, while supplies last

At a minimum, we will also be following all mandated venue and state guidelines. **This list, and all protocols, are subject to change if the COVID-19 situation changes. Changes to this policy will only add requirements, and will not remove requirements.**
