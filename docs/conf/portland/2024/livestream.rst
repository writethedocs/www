Live Stream
===========

The livestream page will be updated with the live stream link shortly before the event starts.
Refresh the page on the day of the conference talks to see them!

You do **not** need a ticket to watch the live stream,
however we do provide a `livestream ticket <https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-portland-2024/with/livestream-ticket>`_ without a set price if you want to give back.

If you experience technical issues, please report them in the #wtd-conferences channel on Slack.
