Announcing Portland conference speakers
=======================================

Our Portland conference is less than 3 months away, and we're thrilled to see everyone in {{city}}.
It's the perfect time to buy your tickets and arrange your travel.

Today's major news is the speakers and talks for the conference. 
A huge thank you to all who submitted a proposal;
our event wouldn't be possible without you!

2024 Portland conference speakers
---------------------------------

Every year we strive to bring a diverse array of voices to our stage. As the role of "documentarian" varies greatly among us, we aim for topics that cover a broad spectrum of practical, philosophical, and technical ideas â€“ with a sprinkle of whimsical ones for good measure.

We're excited about the `talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/speakers/>`_ lined up for this year:
