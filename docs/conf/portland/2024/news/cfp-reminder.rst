In other conference news, `tickets are on sale <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_, and you can still `apply for an opportunity grant <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/opportunity-grants/>`_, read on for more information.

Submit your talk by **{{ cfp.ends }}**

You still have almost two weeks to submit your talk to the conference.
Check out the `Call for Proposals page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`_ for more details about what would make a great talk.

If you already have an idea but youâ€™re having a hard time getting your proposal to come together,
you can always ask for talk feedback on the `Write the Docs Slack <https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`_.

Get your ticket for the conference
----------------------------------

**The Portland conference will be held on {{ date.short }}**, in Revolution Hall.

The `full event website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/>`_ is live and already includes many details. We'll be updating it with more information as we get closer to the event.

If you're excited to join us again in person,
go ahead and `register for your ticket now <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_!
We are still planning to limit capacity of the event to ensure that we have a safe and community-focused experience for everyone,
so we expect tickets to sell out a few weeks before the conference.

Similar to our past conferences, we're going to have a wide range of ways to engage:

- Speaker Presentations
- Writing Day
- Unconference Sessions
- Sponsor Expo + Job Fair
- Welcome Reception
- Conference Party

We're excited to see you all in Portland again soon.

Opportunity Grants

Interested in attending but need extra financial support? We strive to provide an accessible conference for folks of all backgrounds to join. Our opportunity grant application is open until **{{ grants.ends }}**.
