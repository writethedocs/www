In other conference news, `tickets are on sale <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_, and you can still `apply for an opportunity grant <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/opportunity-grants/>`_, read on for more information on any of that good stuff.

Submit your talk by **{{ cfp.ends }}**
--------------------------------------------------

You still have almost two weeks to submit your talk to the conference.
Check out the `Call for Proposals page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`_ for more details about what would make a great talk.

If you already have an idea but you’re having a hard time getting your proposal to come together,
you can always ask for talk feedback on the `Write the Docs Slack <https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`_.
The community is there to help!

The most important dates to remember:

* Talk proposals are due by {{ cfp.ends }}.
* Everyone who submits will get a response by {{ cfp.notification }}.

Get your ticket for the conference
----------------------------------

**The Portland conference will be held on {{ date.short }}**, in Revolution Hall.

The `full event website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/>`_ is live and already includes many details. We'll be updating it with more information as we get closer to the event.

If you're excited to join us again in person,
go ahead and `register for your ticket now <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_!
We are still planning to limit capacity of the event to ensure that we have a safe and community-focused experience for everyone,
so we expect tickets to sell out a few weeks before the conference.

Similar to our past conferences, we're going to keep as much of the spirit of the event as possible:

- Speaker Presentations
- Writing Day
- Unconference Sessions
- Sponsor Expo + Job Fair
- Welcome Reception
- Conference Party

We're excited to see you all in Portland again soon.

Opportunity Grants
------------------

Interested in attending but need extra financial support? We strive to provide an accessible conference for folks of all backgrounds to join. Our opportunity grant application is open until    **{{ grants.ends }}**.

View our `Opportunity Grants page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/opportunity-grants/>`_ for information and the grant application.


Support our community by sponsoring
-----------------------------------

Every year we are fortunate to have the support of like-minded organizations and communities,
who believe in the collaborative and welcoming community spirit and help us make our events great.

We have published our `sponsorship prospectus <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/sponsors/prospectus/>`_ for the conference,
and are open for new sponsorship inquiries.
