We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

**We plan to launch our CFP in November** for those who are excited to speak.
Start thinking about your talk proposal now,
and we'll let you know as soon as the CFP opens.
