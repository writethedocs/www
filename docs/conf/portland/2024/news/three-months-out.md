## Convince Your Manager

Do you need help justifying why your employer should send you to Write the Docs? Don't worry -- you're not alone. Based on the experiences of some of our previous attendees, we've put together a sample email and list of resources.

## Opportunity Grant Deadline is February 1

This program is open to anyone who would otherwise have difficulties attending the conference. Everyone is encouraged to apply regardless of your experience level, background, or reason making it difficult for you to cover the cost. Eligible costs include the ticket price and/or attendance costs.
