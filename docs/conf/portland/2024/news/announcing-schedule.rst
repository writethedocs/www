Announcing Full Schedule
========================

Happy leap day folks!

The {{city}} conference is less than two months away, and we're busy making things happen behind the scenes.

You've already seen our list of :doc:`awesome speakers </conf/portland/{{year}}/speakers/>`, now we're announcing our full schedule so you know when they will be presenting!

Full presentation schedule
--------------------------

The conference website is now updated with the :doc:`schedule </conf/portland/{{year}}/schedule/>` for the main stage presentations, so you can start planning your time (and getting excited!) for the conference. 

We're keeping the moderated Q&A session after each speaker that we introduced last year. You'll have a chance to ask our speakers questions after the talk via our wonderful set of moderators.

Now is a great time to buy your `tickets <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_ if you haven't already.

Join us for our hike again this year
------------------------------------

Our hike will be in the amazing Forest Park, the largest urban forested park in the country. It is conveniently located in Northwest Portland, and has a beautiful walk along a creek.

We'll be starting at Lower Macleay Park on Saturday, **{{ hike.date }}** at 1 PM. Please register a `free hike ticket <https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-portland-2024/with/hike-ticket>`_ so we can contact you with any last minute weather and logistics information.

Start thinking about Writing Day

`Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/writing-day/>`_ takes place on Sunday, the first day of the conference. Itâ€™s a great opportunity to get interesting people in the same room, sharing their passion and goals and collaborating to find creative solutions to solve a problem or issue.

T-shirts are now available
--------------------------

The `Write the Docs {{city}} {{year}} Pop-Up Shop <https://shirt.writethedocs.org/>`_ is open! We have loose and fitted options from different fabrics, and you can choose exactly the size and cut you want. As in previous years, we're doing the pop-up shop option so people can order the exact shirt they want, if they want one. 

The campaign will run in batches until May 31st. Shipping is available from the USA or Europe. We recommend you order your shirt at least 2-3 weeks in advance if you want to sport your fancy new garb during the conference.

All our events and activities
-----------------------------

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Every year we make sure to have a variety of activities that our attendees can enjoy, whether you want to learn something, meet new people, or share knowledge.

The main events that you can participate in Monday & Tuesday are:

* **Lightning Talks.** We'll have `lightning talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/lightning-talks/>`__ each conference day after lunch. These are 5 minute presentations and a lot of fun. They can be about anything you want! This is your chance to share something you are passionate about with the audience. Slides are not required.
* **Unconference.** We'll be running the `Unconference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/unconference/>`_ as our formal "second track" at the conference. This is a place to schedule discussions about a specific topic, so you can find other attendees who care about the same niche topics that you love. Want to chat with like-minded folks about oxford commas or a specific docs as code tool? This is the place.
* **Social event**. On Monday night we'll be hosting a social event. This is a great chance to get to know more folks in the community and have a drink or two on us. Non-alcoholic options will be very available, as well as some snacks.

View our `Attendee Guide <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2024/attendee-guide/>`_ for a comprehensive overview of how to participate in the conference.

The `Schedule page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/schedule/>`_ has the latest and most complete information about all our events.
This is where we will also update any changes/cancellations if they should occur.
