## FAQs

### How many shifts am I required to volunteer?

Each volunteer must work two assigned shifts 3-4 hours in length. Each individual who volunteers for two shifts receives a free ticket to the conference. If you want to volunteer more shifts, please contact katie@writethedocs.org.

### What volunteer roles do you have?

#### Writing Day

- Assist the Writing Day coordinator, direct attendees to specific tables, and support writing day project leads with logistical questions.

#### Registration

Check in attendees, provide general information inquiries, answer venue questions, and field other requests or direct individuals to the correct staff member who can provide support.

#### Stage Support

- Assist presenters while on stage - troubleshoot issues with slides, video, or audio portions of their presentation. Please apply for this role if you have some A/V knowledge; it is not required, but experience with different operating systems is a plus!

#### Unconference

- Assist the Unconference coordinator, help folks sign up to host a session, maintain an updated schedule, direct individuals and groups to their tables, and minimal clean up of tables.

#### Catering

- Set up catering, replenish beverages and snacks, and notify venue staff of coffee refills and cleaning needs.

#### Venue Load Out

- What's more fun than setting things up? Taking them down! Load out conference set up and leave the conference hall better than we found it.

### Will travel assistance be provided?

Unfortunately, we cannot offer travel assistance to volunteers. We encourage you to apply for the Opportunity Grant. Deadline is February 1. [Apply here today!](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2024/opportunity-grants/)
