# Visiting Portland

Welcome to Portand, the largest city in the state of Oregon with a population of over 2.2 million people in the greater metro area. The conference takes place in inner Southeast Portland at Revolution Hall and is conveniently situated near outstanding options for food, bars, and hotels.

"Portland is perhaps best known for being a sustainability-minded, bike-friendly city with easy access to nature; plentiful coffee, art, craft beer, delicious food and live music; and crafty people who celebrate individuality and creativity," writes [Travel Portland](https://www.travelportland.com/).

## Getting Around

Portland is an accessible city and there are many transportation options available, public and otherwise. Portland is divided into six quadrants (with Burnside Avenue delineating north and south sections, and the Willamette River separating west and east sections). It is a city of neighborhoods, and each has its own distinct personality. We encourage you to connect with other documentarians and explore our unique neighborhoods during your stay.

### Public Transportation

Portland has a bus, light rail, and streetcar lines to get around the city. Check the [TriMet Trip Planner](https://trimet.org/home/) for more information.

#### **Bus**

There are four bus lines that run close to Revolution Hall.

If you're coming from downtown:

-   Line 15 (Belmont)
-   Line 12 (Sandy Blvd.)
-   Line 19 (Glisan)
-   Line 20 (Burnside)

If you are coming from the Convention Center area:

-   Line 70 (12th Ave.)

#### **Light Rail and Streetcar Line**

The [MAX](https://trimet.org/max/) is Portland's major light-rail system. The MAX primarily connects Portland with the surrounding cities, such as Gresham, Beaverton, Clackamas, and Hillsboro. If you're flying into Portland Airport (PDX), there is a MAX station for the [Red Line](https://trimet.org/schedules/maxredline.htm) in the airport itself.

The [Portland Streetcar](https://portlandstreetcar.org/) serves areas surrounding downtown. There is a dropoff location 7 blocks from the venue.

If you are planning on using the MAX, Portland Streetcar and/or city buses frequently during your stay, it may be worth investing in the [Hop Fastpass fare card system](https://myhopcard.com/home/). It is easy to pay with a card in your mobile wallet for a one-time ride or you may purchase MAX or Streetcar tickets from a machine at the airport. Purchase before boarding.

TriMet Adult fares:

-   2.5 hour = $2.80
-   Day Pass = $5.60

Use the [TriMet Trip Planner](https://trimet.org/home/) to plan your trip!

### Rideshare and Taxi

We recommend using **Lyft** or **Uber** to get around Portland. If you prefer local taxi companies, here are a few recommendations:

-   [Radio Cab](https://www.radiocab.net/)
-   [Broadway Cab](https://broadwaycab.com/)

Please note that it is ***not*** common to hail taxis in Portland, and you must call in advance.

### Bike Rentals

There is a bike rental company and bikeshare program in downtown Portland if you want to experience Portland by bike (which we very much recommend). Make sure to check your route online for elevation changes - parts of Portland are very hilly!
