Sponsor Expo
============

This year we're inviting our top sponsors to engage with our attendees at our Sponsor Expo.
This is a combination of two things:

* Companies that are hiring, where companies can talk with attendees who are interested in work.
* Companies that build products for docs folks, where you can learn more about what people are building.

We're looking forward to facilitating constructive networking, connecting people with jobs and employers, and hearing more from some of our sponsors.
