# Opportunity Grants

The Grant program for Write the Docs Portland 2025 supports people who would otherwise not be able to attend the conference by covering ticket and/or attendance costs. 

## Eligibility

Applications are open to anyone who wants to attend Write the Docs. We encourage anyone to apply who would otherwise have difficulty attending.

You are welcome to apply regardless of your experience level, background, or reason making it difficult for you to cover the cost.

You are welcome to apply, even if you have received a grant before from our conferences or any others.

We prioritize applications based on the overall impact that granting an application will have on the applicant, the Write the Docs community, and the applicant’s wider community and country. However, there are no requirements for you to meet. In other words, if you’re unsure, please apply.

Grant applicants, like all other participants in the Write the Docs community, are required to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/code-of-conduct/).

## Schedule

- **Now - {{ grants.ends }}:** Grant applications open
- **{{ grants.notification }}:** Grant recipients notified

## What is Covered

**All grants include a free conference ticket.** This is the most common and possible grant for us to award. View our [ticket page](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/tickets/) for what is included with a conference ticket.

We can assist with typical costs such as travel and accommodation, but you may request other costs you need covered to attend.

This list can include, but is not limited to:

- Travel (flights, gas, rideshare, etc.)
- Accommodations
- Meals
- Additional expenses (childcare, loss of wages, etc.)

The application form will ask for an estimate of your costs.

## Grant Amounts

The total amount of grant funds to be distributed is based upon sponsors and number of tickets sold. We will not know the full amount until we near the deadline. In 2024, $3,500 was distributed in grant funds. There is no limit on the amount you request, but please consider this amount when making your request. We rarely fund only one individual and aim to use our budget for two or more people. We do not award partial grants.

## Are you part of a marginalized or underrepresented group in tech?

We encourage and may prioritize applications from people who are part of a marginalized or underrepresented group in tech. 

These groups include, but are not limited to:

- Women and other gender minorities of all expressions and identities; for example trans, agender, and non-binary people 
- People of color
- Sexuality minorities, including asexual people
- People with disabilities, both visible and invisible
- Neurodivergent people
- People with chronic illnesses or diseases
- Religious and ethnic minorities
- Age minorities (under ~21, over ~50)
- People experiencing poverty
- Homeless and home/food insecure people
- Caregivers of children or other dependents
- People who have experienced trauma and its aftermath (PTSD, anxiety, etc)
- People living with or recovering from substance abuse

You do not have to tell us which underrepresented group(s) you belong to.

**Note:** Grant applications will be seen only by the conference team, and we will never publish grant applications or publicly name grant recipients. You are of course free to share if you applied or received a grant yourself.
