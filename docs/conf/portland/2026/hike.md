# Hike

Every year we have a conference hike that kicks off the **unofficial** beginning of the conference. It has become a fantastic tradition and is a wonderful way to gather the day before the conference begins.

We will be hiking in the amazing [Forest Park](https://forestparkconservancy.org/), the largest urban forested park in the country. It is conveniently located in Northwest Portland, and has a beautiful walk along a creek. 

**The hike is around 5 miles long with 1,200 feet of elevation gain and is classified as a moderate hike. We’ll be going nice and slow so people can appreciate the views and forest.**

It's rained on us in the past, but we have faith it will be beautiful this year! We will hopefully see Mount Hood at the top :)

## What to Bring

- **Lightweight rain jacket** - it likely will not be too cold, but it might drizzle on you.
- **High spirits!**

We hope you will join us for this pre-conference activity!
