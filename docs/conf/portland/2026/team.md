Janine is a documentation nerd up in Canada. She feels so lucky to help organize at Write the Docs so she can nerd out in Portland too! She spends her time putting a lot of effort into complex documentation to make it look like it was easy all along, thinking about making inclusion efforts concrete, running unimpressive distances at unimpressive speeds, hiking, knitting, and swing dancing, albeit non-simultaneously. Her cat remains staunchly uninterested in all of this.
