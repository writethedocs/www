# Social Events

Write the Docs is a community conference,
which means a big part of the experience is meeting and getting to know other documentarians.
Along with the talks and Unconference sessions,
we have a few social events planned to help you connect with other attendees.

## Sunday Reception

We encourage everyone to drop by on Sunday evening for the conference reception.
This is a great chance to meet other attendees,
and make sure you know your way around the conference venue.

**Where**: {{about.venue}}, {{about.unconfroom}}  
**When**: 5-7 PM

*Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and snacks will be provided.*

## Monday Night Social

Join us for our Monday night social event! This is a great chance to meet more of your fellow documentarians 
and chat about the conference in a relaxed atmosphere.

**Where**: {{about.social_venue}}  
**When**: 7-9 PM

*Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and snacks will be provided.*
