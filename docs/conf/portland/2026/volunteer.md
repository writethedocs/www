# Volunteer Information

Our volunteer sign up form is open. We are looking for volunteers to provide support with a variety of conference roles - registration, Writing Day, Unconference, float, catering, load out, and more.

Completing this form signs you up to volunteer. We will close the form once volunteer capacity is reached. Another form will be sent out once the speaker schedule is released mid-February.

Each individual must volunteer for two or more 3-4 hour shifts and receives a **free ticket** to the conference.

## Volunteer Roles

### Writing Day

- Assist the Writing Day coordinator, direct attendees to specific tables, and support writing day project leads with logistical questions.

### Registration

- Check in attendees, provide general information inquiries, answer venue questions, and field other requests or direct individuals to the correct staff member who can provide support.

### Unconference

- Assist the Unconference coordinator, help folks sign up to host a session, maintain an updated schedule, direct individuals and groups to their tables, and keep tables looking neat.

### Float

- Provide support where needed. Be a runner. Support staff with catering set up.

### Venue Load Out

- What's more fun than setting things up? Taking them down! Load out conference set up and leave the conference hall better than we found it.

## Will travel assistance be provided?

Unfortunately, we cannot offer travel assistance to volunteers. We encourage you to apply for the Opportunity Grant. [View grant application here!](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/opportunity-grants/) 

Contact katie@writethedocs.org with any additional questions.
