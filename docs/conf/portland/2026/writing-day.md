# What is Writing Day?

Held on Sunday, Writing Day marks the official start of the conference.

Writing Day is modeled after the concept of [code sprints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_%28software_development%29) or hackathons, which are common in open-source (OSS) conferences. Traditionally, this day has centered on collaborative work with attendees bringing a project to lead and/or contributing to someone else's project, typically half-day or full-day sessions.

## How to participate in Writing Day in 2026

To create more ways for attendees to take part on Sunday, we are expanding Writing Day to include additional, shorter-format options such as workshops and discussions.

- Writing Day (half-day or full-day projects)
- New to GitHub workshops
- Resume writing session
- A pre-scheduled, discussion-based track

More information about these offerings will be shared in the coming months.

## Writing Day schedule

**{{date.day_two.dotw}}, {{date.day_two.date}}, {{date.day_two.writing_day_time}} {{tz}}**

Writing Day is an all-day event designed for you to join in throughout the day. Whether you want to contribute to a half-day project, join an hour-long discussion, or attend a GitHub workshop, there is an option for you.

Exact times will be posted on our [schedule page](/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/schedule/).

## How to Prepare

**Come prepared with the following tools:**

- Laptop, tablet, or other device
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) account (you may also want a [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) account)
- Text editor of your choice for coding or content creation

## Lead a Project

Leading a project at Writing Day is a wonderful opportunity to engage with documentarians from a variety of backgrounds, experience, and expertise. Their collective wealth of experience can help you upgrade your project documentation and create a more inclusive project. This empowers all of us to work together to create opportunities for each other and bigger, better communities.

**Tips to create and lead a new project effectively:**

- **Provide a project overview with a specific focus or goals:** Your project overview is a 2 minute pitch that describes your project and clearly defines a focus area or goal.
- **Pre-label tasks and issues:** Create a specific event label and label documentation tasks and issues. This empowers new contributors to find tasks that interest them.
- **Create a task filter:** This helps contributors find issues more easily and see which issues have been assigned.
- **Clear onboarding:** Ensure your README, contribution guidelines, or onboarding instructions are accurate and up to date.
- **Project experts:** We recommend having 1-2 people leading a project. You are welcome to call for virtual reinforcements from your community as well.
- **Flexibility and understanding:** Reminder that attendees may need additional info to be successful in onboarding to your project.
- **Submit your Writing Day project before the conference:** Projects submitted by **April 22, 2026** are featured in our pre-conference blog post and email. Many attendees have shared that their curiosity for specific projects motivated them to attend. Project submissions open in February/March.

These are suggestions and not requirements. It is perfectly valid to show up to Writing Day the day of, tell us about your project, and ask for volunteers. It has been done before and it will be done again.

## Contribute to a Project

If you are a Writing Day attendee looking to contribute to a project, check out the project list. Reminder: some projects are submitted the day of during announcements.

**Tips to contribute to a project:**

- Regardless of your experience level, you are welcome here. We are excited to have you. Even if you feel you lack the right skills, experiences, or have never attended an event like Writing Day before, you will be surprised at how much you can contribute.
- **Explore our guide to writing documentation.** Our [Beginners Guide](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/) is designed to help you get started and spark ideas for how you can contribute to a project.
- **Ask questions.** If you encounter challenges with new concepts and tools, you are in a room surrounded by friendly people from diverse backgrounds and experiences. You can always ask the Welcome Wagon or Registration staff and volunteers. We will help you connect with the right person.
- **View the project list.** Check out the projects that have been submitted in advance.

## Submit your project

We encourage you to submit a Writing Day project in advance. **If you submit your project by April 3, we will share your project in a blog post and email with our attendees before the conference.**
