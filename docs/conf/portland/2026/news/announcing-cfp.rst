Announcing the Call for Proposals and Sponsorship Prospectus
============================================================

We're now accepting talks for `Write the Docs {{city}} {{year}} <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`_!

We're also launching our updated `sponsorship prospectus <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/sponsors/prospectus/>`_.

Our full website and tickets will be live soon.
Read on for more details about getting involved this year.

Call for Proposals
------------------

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our welcoming community of documentarians.

If there's something you'd really like to see a talk on this year, submit a proposal, or send the submission link to someone else you would like to hear from!

We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

We're mainly looking for talk proposals to be delivered in-person, on-stage in Portland, on {{ date.short }}.

But that's not all, this year we're also opening up a couple of talk slots for pre-recorded videos for remote speakers, so if you can't make it to {{city}} on {{ date.short }} you can still submit your proposal.

You can read our full `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`__, and `submit your talk <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`__ on the website.

The Call for Proposals will be open until **11:59 PM {{cfp.ends}} PST**, so harness that new year energy!

Sponsorship Updates
-------------------

Our `sponsorship prospectus <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/sponsors/prospectus/>`_ is updated for {{ year }},
and we're excited to have more ways for companies to get involved this year.

Our sponsors are the folks building the tools and platforms that we use everyday, and they help make Write the Docs conferences possible.
If that sounds like your company, please consider joining us again in this year!
