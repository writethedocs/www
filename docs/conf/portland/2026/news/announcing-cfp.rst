Announcing the Call for Proposals and Sponsorship Prospectus
============================================================

We're excited to announce our Portland `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`_!

We're also launching our `sponsorship prospectus <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/sponsors/prospectus/>`_ with updated offerings based on feedback from last year.

Our full website and tickets will be live soon.

Read on for more details about getting involved this year.

Call for Proposals
------------------

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our welcoming community of documentarians.

If there's something you'd really like to see a talk on this year, submit a proposal, or send the submission link to someone else you would like to hear from!

We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

We're looking for talk proposals to be delivered in-person, on-stage in Portland, on {{ date.short }}.

New for 2026, we're also accepting a limited number of pre-recorded talks from remote speakers, so if you can't make it to {{city}} on {{ date.short }} you can still submit your proposal.

You can read our full `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`__, and `submit your talk <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`__ on the website.

The Call for Proposals will be open until **11:59 PM {{cfp.ends}} PST**, so harness that new year energy!

Sponsorship Updates
-------------------

Our `sponsorship prospectus <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/sponsors/prospectus/>`_ is updated for {{ year }},
with various improvements based on sponsor feedback.

Our sponsors are the folks building the tools and platforms that we use every day, and they help make Write the Docs conferences possible.
If that sounds like your company, please consider joining us this year!
