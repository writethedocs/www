# Reminders: Call for Feedback and Proposals, Tickets, Opportunity Grants, and Volunteering

Happy New Year, fellow documentarians!

As we enter {{year}}, we're looking forward to Write the Docs {{city}} and sending some reminders to kick the year off. We hope you're planning to join us for the {{year}} conference.

Today is mostly a reminder that we're accepting talk proposals until **{{ cfp.ends }}**. Opportunity grants and Volunteer applications are still open as well. And of course, tickets are on sale!

## Give feedback on Writing Day

We’re considering changing the format of Writing Day and want to hear your thoughts! If you’ve attended in the past, we’d love to hear what you liked, what you didn’t, and anything you think would make it better. If you haven’t attended, what kinds of things would pique your interest? Would you be more likely to attend if the sessions were shorter? Do you want sessions where you are doing actual writing, or more sessions where we discuss things similar to the Unconference? Email [portland@writethedocs.org](mailto:portland@writethedocs.org) with any ideas.

## Submit your talk by {{ cfp.ends }}

You still have time to submit your talk proposal for the conference. Check out the [Call for Proposals page](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp) for more details about what would make a great talk.

If you already have an idea but are having a difficult time getting your proposal together, you can always ask for talk feedback on the [Write the Docs Slack](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/). The community is here to help!

- Talk proposals are due by {{ cfp.ends }}.
- Everyone who submits will receive a response by {{ cfp.notification }}.

### Opportunity grants are open

Interested in attending but need extra financial support? We strive to provide an accessible conference for folks of all backgrounds to join. Our opportunity grant application is open until **{{ grants.ends }}**.

### Calling all Volunteers

Interested in being a part of making the conference happen? We are looking for volunteers to provide support with a variety of conference roles - registration, Writing Day, Unconference, float, catering, load out, and more. Volunteers who do two or more 3-4 hour shifts receive a free ticket to the conference! Apply through our [Volunteer page](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/volunteer/).
