# Visiting Portland Information and Conference Updates

Hello fellow documentarians!

We're just over three months out from the conference and want to share a few important updates to help you plan your visit to Portland. 

## Visiting Portland page is live!

Our [Visiting Portland](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2026/visiting/) page has the latest updates. This year, we're excited to partner with two new hotels, and share even more delicious food and drink options. 

### Hotel Recommendations

**Jupiter Hotel**

The [Jupiter](https://www.jupiterhotel.com/) is again one of our partner hotels and is one of the closest options. It's also where we're hosting our Monday evening social. 
*Please note: rooms are only available starting May 3 this year.*

**New partner hotels: Hotel Lucia and Sentinel Hotel**

- [Hotel Lucia](https://be.synxis.com/?adult=1&arrive=2026-04-30&chain=22402&child=0&currency=USD&depart=2026-05-07&group=GRWRDO&hotel=49677&level=hotel&locale=en-US&productcurrency=USD&rooms=1&src=24C) is a wonderful downtown hotel offering competitive rates.
- [Sentinel Hotel](https://be.synxis.com/?adult=1&arrive=2026-04-30&chain=21123&child=0&currency=USD&depart=2026-05-07&group=1529821&hotel=76781&level=hotel&locale=en-US&productcurrency=USD&rooms=1) is a historic luxury hotel featuring Fortune, its bar and lounge with a plant-based menu.

Both are close to the Pearl district and Powell's books, offer a nightly drink hour, and are an eight-minute drive or rideshare to the venue. They also offer bike rentals. 

Be sure to book through the links above to get the Write the Docs rates.
