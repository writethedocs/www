Write the Docs Hike
===================

Every year we have a conference hike, and at this point it's a fantastic tradition.
We'll be doing the same hike again this year, because it's the best one easily accessible from downtown Portland.

It's rained on us the past, but we have faith it will be beautiful this year! We will hopefully see Mount Hood at the top :)

We will be hiking in the amazing `Forest Park <http://www.forestparkconservancy.org/>`__, the largest urban forested park in the country.
It is conveniently located in Northwest Portland, not far from the conference venue. It's about a 35 minute walk
from the venue to the park, or you can `take transit <https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Crystal+Ballroom,+1332+W+Burnside+St,+Portland,+OR+97209,+United+States/MacLeay+Park+Entrance,+Northwest+Upshur+Street,+Portland,+OR/@45.5290603,-122.707244,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x54950a02e43decb9:0xe289ad93ad758c66!2m2!1d-122.68483!2d45.522785!1m5!1m1!1s0x549509e98d3dabd5:0xe1f0810cfb8e8ca8!2m2!1d-122.712528!2d45.535874!3e3?hl=en>`__ to make it a bit quicker.

**Note**

The hike does not end where it starts. Take this into consideration when you plan.
There is an out-and-back option if you choose to just go to Pittock Mansion, then return back down to the start.
