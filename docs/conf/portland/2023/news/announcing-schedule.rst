Announcing Full Schedule
========================

Hey folks!

The {{city}} conference is less than two months away, and we're busy making things happen behind the scenes, and remembering how in-person conferences work again.

You've already seen our list of awesome speakers, now we can also show you the schedule so you know when they will be presenting!

Full presentation schedule
--------------------------

The conference website is now updated with the :doc:`schedule </conf/portland/{{year}}/schedule/>` for the main stage presentations, so you can start planning your time (and getting excited!) for the conference. 

We're learning and adapting from our virtual events from the past few years, so we're introducing a moderated Q&A session after each speaker. You'll have a chance to ask most of our speakers questions after the talk via our wonderful set of moderators.

Now is a great time to buy your `tickets <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_ if you haven't already.
Also please read over our `Health and Safety policy <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2023/health/>`__,
so you understand the measures we're taking to keep our attendees safe.

Join us for our hike again this year
------------------------------------

We're reviving the traditional Pittock Mansion `hike <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/outing/>`_ on Saturday. This is a great way to experience the beauty that Portland holds within city limits, with a walk along a creek, a majestic view of Mount Hood, and finishing with a meader through Hoyt Arboritum with hundreds of different trees and plants. 

The hike will be on  **{{ hike.date }}**. Please register a `free ticket <https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-portland-2023/with/hike-ticket>`_ so we can contact you with any last minute weather and logistics information.

Start thinking about Writing Day
--------------------------------

Our pre-conference `Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/writing-day/>`_ is happening on Sunday. It's a great chance to learn from other attendees, and get some contributors on a project you have in mind. There is also room for having discussions and showing off fun new tools you've found.

If you have a project or are part of a community that you think would benefit from a writing sprint, start brainstorming now about what you might want to focus on.

If you'd like us to include your project on the Writing Day page `submit your project here <https://forms.gle/NNBzBCwjdB2vF7ZeA>`_ or drop us an email at `portland@writethedocs.org <mailto:portland@writethedocs.org>`_. You are also welcome to show up on Sunday ready to introduce your project!

T-shirts are now available
--------------------------

The `Write the Docs {{city}} {{year}} Pop-Up Shop <https://shirt.writethedocs.org/>`_ is open! We have loose and fitted options from different fabrics, and you can choose exactly the size and cut you want. As in previous years, we're doing the pop-up shop option so people can order the exact shirt they want, if they want one. 

The campaign will run in batches until May 31st. Shipping is available from the USA or Europe. We recommend you order your shirt at least 2-3 weeks in advance if you want to sport your fancy new garb during the conference.

All our events and activities
-----------------------------

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Every year we make sure to have a variety of activities that our attendees can enjoy, whether you want to learn something, meet new people, or share knowledge.

The main events that you can participate in Monday & Tuesday are:

* **Lightning Talks.** We'll have `lightning talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/lightning-talks/>`__ each conference day after lunch. These are 5 minute presentations and a lot of fun. They can be about anything you want! This is your chance to share something you are passionate about with the audience. Slides are not required.
* **Unconference.** We'll be running the `Unconference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/unconference/>`_ as our formal "second track" at the conference. This is a place to schedule discussions about a specific topic, so you can find other attendees who care about the same niche topics that you love. Want to chat with like-minded folks about oxford commas or a specific docs as code tool? This is the place.
* **Social event**. On Monday night we'll be hosting a quiet social event. This is a great chance to get to know more folks in the community and have a drink or two on us. Non-alcoholic options will be very available, as well as some snacks.

The `Schedule page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/schedule/>`_ has the latest and most complete information about all our events.
This is where we will also update any changes/cancellations if they should occur.
