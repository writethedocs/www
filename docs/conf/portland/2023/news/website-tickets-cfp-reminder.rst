Announcing ticket sales, full conference website, and CFP reminder
==================================================================

Happy New Year, fellow documentarians!

As we get ready to start the year, we're happy to share the latest update about the Portland conference.
The most important parts:

* `Tickets <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_ for the conference are on sale.
* Submit your `talk <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`_ by **{{ cfp.ends }}**.
* Our full `event website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/>`_ is now live, with lots of information about the conference.

Read on for more details!

Get your ticket for the conference
----------------------------------

**The Portland conference will be held on {{ date.short }}.**
The `full event website <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/>`_ is live and already includes many details. We'll be updating it with more information as we get closer to the event. 

We have a few big changes this year, after such a long break.
First off, we have an exciting :doc:`new venue </conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/venue>` with much more space, and lots of outdoor access.
We're also doing a new experiment where we're only catering drinks and snacks,
and letting folks walk around the neighborhood to experience all the wonderful Portland lunch options.
Our venue is located very close to a couple great vegan places,
as well as many other exciting food options.
We'll have a set of recommends and a map as the conference gets closer. 

If you're excited to join us again in person,
go ahead and `register for your ticket now <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_!
We are still planning to limit capacity of the event to ensure that we have a safe and community-focused experience for everyone,
so we expect tickets to sell out a few weeks before the conference.

Similar to our past conferences, we're going to keep as much of the spirit of the event as possible:

* Excellent single track of presentations with wide-ranging talks
* Writing Day
* Unconference sessions
* Job Fair
* Sponsor booths
* A much expanded hallway track!

We're excited to see you again here soon.

Submit your talk by **{{ cfp.ends }}**
--------------------------------------------------

You still have plenty of time to submit your talk to the conference.

If you already have an idea but youâ€™re having a hard time getting your proposal to come together,
you can always ask for talk feedback on the `Write the Docs Slack <https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`_.
The community is there to help!

The most important dates to remember:

* Talk proposals are due by {{ cfp.ends }}.
* Everyone who submits will get a response by {{ cfp.notification }}.

Support our community by sponsoring
-----------------------------------

Every year we are fortunate to have the support of like-minded organizations and communities,
who believe in the collaborative and welcoming community spirit and help us make our events great.

We have published our `sponsorship prospectus <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/sponsors/prospectus/>`_ for the conference,
and are open for new sponsorship inquiries.

We have some interesting new sponsorship options with sponsored workshops.
We will also run the `job fair <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/job-fair/>`_ again this year,
helping documentarians and organizations connect with each other.
Check out the sponsorship prospectus for more details and to reserve your spot today.

Looking forward to seeing you all here soon!
