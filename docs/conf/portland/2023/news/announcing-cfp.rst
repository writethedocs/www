Announcing Venue and Call for Proposals
=======================================

Today we are announcing our new Portland conference venue. 
The needs of our conference have changed over the years, and we have decided to move to a lovely new space in Portland. 
We're also excited to announce our Portland `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`_.

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our inspiring community of documentarians.
If there is something youâ€™d really like to see a talk on this year, submit a proposal on it, or refer someone else who would be good!

Our new venue: Revolution Hall
------------------------------

Our Portland conference will be held at `Revolution Hall`_. 
It is a beautiful concert venue located on the `thriving inner east side`_ of Portland.
It was converted from a high school,
and still has some lockers in the hallway for that extra learning ambiance.

The venue has a large and beautiful primary theater,
as well as many other social spaces:

* The Assembly Lounge where we will be hosting our Unconference discussions
* The Sunset Room which will be our Quiet room
* The Library room where our snacks and drinks catering will happen

It also has *outdoor seating* and a *city park* directly on the property for plenty of fresh air and free space.

Health and safety policy

As part of returning to an in-person conference, we're also introducing a new and more detailed :doc:`health and safety policy </conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/health/>`.

Call for Proposals
------------------

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manager, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

**For 2023 we are going back to an in-person event**.

You can read our full `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/cfp/>`__ on the website.

The Call for Proposals will be open until **11:59 PM {{cfp.ends}} PST**.

(If you'd prefer not to attend an in-person event due to COVID-19 or any other reason, keep an eye out for `Atlantic_news`_ held online in a timezone as widely accessible as possible).

Write the Docs Atlantic, online September 2023
----------------------------------------------

If you want to speak at Write the Docs, but can't or don't want to attend an in-person event, keep an eye out for Write the Docs Atlantic, coming in September 2023.
This conference will be entirely virtual, in a timezone that works for as many people as possible, so you can present or attend from anywhere.

Tickets

Tickets will officially go on sale early **2023**.

As always, we keep ticket prices low so that the event is accessible to the widest range of people possible.
However, if you can't afford the tickets and still wish to attend, we will launch our grants program soon after opening ticket sales.
