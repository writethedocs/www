Announcing Venue and Call for Proposals
=======================================

Today we are announcing our new Portland conference venue. 
The needs of our conference have changed over the years, and have decided to move to a lovely new space in Portland. 
We're also excited to announce our Portland `Call for Proposals <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp/>`_.

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our inspiring community of documentarians.
If there is something you’d really like to see a talk on this year, submit a proposal on it, or refer someone else who would be good!

Our new venue: Revolution Hall
------------------------------

Our Portland conference will be held at `Revolution Hall`_. 
It is a beautiful concert venue located on the `thriving inner east side`_ of Portland.
It was converted from a high school,
and still have some lockers in the hallway for that extra learning ambiance.

The venue has a large and beautiful primary theater,
as well as many other social spaces:

* The Assembly Lounge where we will be hosting our Unconference discussions
* The Sunset Room which will be our Quiet room
* The Library room where our snacks and drinks catering will happen

It also has *outdoor seating* and a *city park* directly on the property for plenty of fresh air and free space.
