Conference videos, photos, and info to keep in touch
====================================================

Hey everyone,

Our team is now emerging from the post-conference
recovery period, and we wanted to send out a quick message to thank
everyone for helping to make our conference such a
success. We appreciate everyone who makes the conference possible:
speakers, sponsors, organizers, and attendees alike!

Its especially gratifying to see so many folks join us in what has been a really tough year so for many,
and in our first in-person conference in 4 years!

Conference recap
----------------

At almost **350 attendees** this conference was another smashing success!
We had the usual mix of talks on the main stage along with Q&A,
lightning talks, unconference sessions,
writing sprints, social event, and sponsor expo.
We thought everything went pretty smoothly this year, even getting used to a new venue.

Talk videos
-----------

`Videos of the talks`_ are now available on YouTube. This
includes all conference talks with Q&A, as well as the lightning talks.
You can also subscribe to our `YouTube channel`_ so you don’t miss any future content.

Thanks again to all our presenters, moderator, and folks who asked wonderful questions!

Code of Conduct transparency report
-----------------------------------

As with any Write the Docs event,
this conference was covered by our `community Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__.
We aim to be as transparent with CoC incidents and enforcement as we can.

To ensure that our CoC was visible and accessible, we took a number of specific steps:

- Every participant agreed to the Code of Conduct in advance during registration.
- The CoC, or a summary, was included on the conference website and around the venue.
- The CoC was repeatedly mentioned in our conference introduction and announcements.
- We specifically stressed that the CoC applies to all conference spaces including the social event.
- We encouraged all attendees to report any incident, even if they were not sure whether it was a violation.

None of our organizers were approached about any CoC concerns at this event.
We know that this is, in part, a reflection of the thoughtful and inclusive community that we're so lucky to have.

That being said, we're also very conscious of the fact that just because
nothing was reported doesn't mean nothing happened. If there was any personal
conduct or other aspect of the conference experience that did not meet the
expectations of behavior set out in the CoC, please email us at
`conduct@writethedocs.org <mailto:conduct@writethedocs.org>`_.

Thanks again

even sooner at one of our other events!
