Doc Detective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Meet the Team, Test Your Docs, and Contribute to Ours.*

`Doc Detective <https://github.com/doc-detective/doc-detective>`__ is
an open-source documentation testing framework that aims to make
it easy to keep your docs accurate and up-to-date. You write
low-code (soon no-code) tests, and Doc Detective runs them
directly against your product to make sure your docs match your
user experience. Whether it's a UI-based process or a series of
API calls, Doc Detective can help you find doc bugs before your
users do.

Doc Detective supports tests in Chrome and Firefox today and plans
to support tests for native iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and
Linux applications in the future.

Our documentation (and source code) is available on GitHub, and
anyone can contribute it:

#. Take a look at the issues labeled "`writing day <https://github.com/doc-detective/doc-detective/labels/writing%20day>`__".

#. If you don’t find something you’d like to work on, view all issues labeled "`documentation <https://github.com/doc-detective/doc-detective/labels/documentation>`__" or browse `the docs <https://github.com/doc-detective/doc-detective>`__ and find something else you’d like to improve (and log it in a new issue).

#. Once you find the issue you want to work on, add a comment mentioning @hawkeyexl to inform us that you’re working on this for Writing Day (and tell us in person!).

#. Create a pull request with your proposed changes.

#. Once your pull request is reviewed and merged, it will appear on the docs site shortly!

Stop by to chat and build some tests for your docs. If you have
any questions, you can reach out to us in person or on
`Discord <https://discord.gg/tTmczpE4Yd>`__.
