Concept
=======

Write the Docs (https://www.writethedocs.org/) is a
**three day conference** focusing on documentation systems, tech writing
theory, and information delivery.

Writing and maintaining documentation involves a multidisciplinary
community of technical writers, designers, librarians, typesetters, developers,
support teams, marketers and many others. This group of people can be
collectively referred to as “documentarians”.

**Write the Docs** creates a time and a place for this community to
share information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve the art
and science of documentation.

For too long, people who care about documentation have felt alone in the
world, not able to connect with their community. Write the Docs is a
magical experience for many of our attendees, allowing them to feel like
they have found their place. We believe this is the most
important thing that our event can do, and we aim to provide that
experience again this year, and make it better than ever.

Demographics
============

We hold multiple conferences yearly:

* One in the United States in the spring
* One in Europe in the fall
* One in Australia in the winter

Our audience is made up of:

- Technical Writers (50%)
- Developers (15%)
- Support Staff (15%)
- Managers (10%)
- Community Contributors, Enthusiasts & Other Folks (10%)

Over 75% of our attendees represent their company at the event.
Almost all attendees are from tech companies,
such as Google or Microsoft.

Why Sponsor
===========

By supporting a Write the Docs event, your company will gain not only visibility
and credibility with front-line documentarians, but also valuable
insights that will help you get the most out of your own documentation efforts.
If you're hiring for docs positions, Write the Docs is also an excellent
opportunity to meet top-notch talent.

Our conferences are run by teams of volunteers, and we work hard to keep ticket
prices affordable for a broad range of attendees. Your sponsorship makes it
possible for all sorts of documentarians to attend our events, whether they're a
freelancer, a student or out of work. Becoming a sponsor demonstrates your
commitment to and support of good documentation, and the people who build it.

Run of Show
===========

This Run of Show provides more context about the event and answers some common questions you may have. 
Please let us know if there is any information missing that would be useful for you.

Sponsorship schedule
--------------------

* **SUNDAY**: The swag tables are available during the Writing Day, if you want to put out swag items early. Sponsor booths are available for setup on Sunday from 10am-4pm, but don't need people staffing them. You're also welcome to lead a Writing Day project if your documentation is open source.

* **MONDAY**: Doors open at 8am, so we recommend arriving around this time to get the most interaction with attendees. This is the official start of the main conference talks, when sponsors tables will need to be staffed. The conference will run until around 5pm.

* **TUESDAY**: The Job Fair will be from 9:30-11:30am, set starts at 8:30am. Sponsor tear down in the main hall will be 4pm on Tuesday. That will be the end of the conference, so feel free to book travel home that evening.

See the :doc:`full schedule </conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/schedule>` for exact timing details.

Sponsorship recommendations
---------------------------

We highly recommend having some kind of pre-recorded video content for your job fair session and expo booth.
You can pin the link to the videos or a landing page on your site to the top of the chat.
Being on online format,
it's really easy for attendees to watch a quick 2-4 minute video before they come and ask additional questions.
We can load these videos in your booth when your staff isn't around,
and we are also happy to put them up on our website under the sponsorship section if you'd like.

Sponsorship spaces
------------------

A quick overview of the spaces in the venue that are important:

* The *main ballroom* is where talks and most sponsorship activity happens. We will have booths & swag tables set up at the back of the main ballroom. Here is a `picture <https://www.flickr.com/photos/writethedocs/34495135662>`__ before the attendees showed up.
* *Lola's Room* is downstairs from the main ballroom. This is where the Unconference & Job Fair will happen. Another `picture <https://www.flickr.com/photos/writethedocs/34536045142/in/album-72157683817839465/>`__ shows the idea.

Sponsorship events
------------------

Job Fair
~~~~~~~~

On Tuesday morning we hold our Job Fair,
which is a wonderful place to connect with our over 500 attendees.
Many of them are looking for jobs now or will be in the near future,
so it's a great chance to talk more about your company culture and open positions.

The room will be setup in a large circle with booths around the outside,
allowing for movement of attendees.
We recommend not having more than 3-4 people at your booth,
as it can be intimidating for attendees.
There are 8 booth areas where you can sit and hold longer conversations.

**Logistics**: You will have a six-foot table and two chairs reserved for your company. Each company that confirms their attendance will have a table reserved for them with their logo on it. Giveaways/flyers are welcome, but please make sure everything fits on your allotted table.

Sponsor booths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sponsor booths are only available for our larger sponsors due to space limitations.
You will be given a booth that is in the back of the Ballroom,
which is the primary conference venue.
Most of the attendee focus will come during breaks (10 minutes between each talk, two longer snack breaks) and at the beginning and end of the day.  

**Logistics**: Booth setup is available Sunday, but they only need to be staffed on Monday and Tuesday. Power and Wifi are available.

* The *large* sponsorship booth is 12 feet
* The *small* sponsorship booth is 6 feet

Writing day
~~~~~~~~~~~

On Sunday we hold our Writing Day.
This is a place where the community gathers to get actual work done.
This generally involved companies hosting a documentation sprint on some piece of documentation that is open source and needs improvements.

If you want to participate in the Writing Day,
it helps to do a bit of work up front.
The best way to prepare is to have a set of issues that you've already picked as "easy for beginners".
Starting with these issues will make it much easier for people to start,
and feel productive.
Make sure you also have good installation instructions and other helpful beginners content as well.

**Logistics**: You can email us before the conference, and we will add your project to the website as a project that attendees can work on. You can also introduce your project to attendees at 9:30 on Sunday during the Writing Day Introduction.

How do I get the most out of my sponsorship?
--------------------------------------------

Come prepared to engage with our community, and to learn just as much as you teach. Engage with our event as attendees as well as sponsors. Send technical staff who can chat with people on the interesting things your company is doing, and get value from the vast amount of insight in the room. We do have some decision makers in the room, but soft sells will work better than hard sales in the environment we strive for.

Who is my primary contact?
--------------------------

Eric Holscher will be your primary contact, but our team is available at sponsorship@writethedocs.org. If you have a time sensitive inquiry, please email the entire team to ensure a timely response.

What happens with my "swag" items?
----------------------------------

We will have a few "swag" tables that are placed around the back of the main ballroom. This will be where sponsor and community stickers & swag will be located, so that attendees are free to pick it up. If you have a booth, you are also welcome to place swag on the booth.

How do I use my sponsorship tickets?
------------------------------------

You should have received a unique URL with a discount code for your sponsorship tickets. We are happy to send it over again, just ask!

How do I use my job postings?
-----------------------------

You can post your jobs to our `job board <https://jobs.writethedocs.org/>`_.
You will be given a discount code that will let you post them for free,
please ask us for this if you don't have it! 
They will be published in our :doc:`Newsletter </newsletter>` every month,
and displayed on our website as well.

What do I need for the job fair?
--------------------------------

The job fair will be a low key event. Every participant will have a six-foot table and two chairs, in a separate room from the primary conference. Giveaways/flyers are welcome, but please keep your setup requirements simple.

What are the table sizes? What is included?
-------------------------------------------

The small sponsorship table is a 6' table, and the large is two 6' tables. These are not standard conference expo halls, but in the main conference venue, so please don't bring anything that will need to be hung or expand more than 2 feet beyond the edge of your area. Wifi & Power will be provided.

How do I ship items?
--------------------

Prior to the event, if you'd like to ship swag, we will send you the mailing address **3 weeks** prior to the event. We can't receive packages before that. Anything sent to us will be available at the venue on the day of the event.

Please ship **no more than 5 boxes**. We can't inventory large numbers of boxes before the conference.
