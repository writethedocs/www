Announcing Write the Docs Portland 2019 CFP
===========================================

Welcome to the official launch of `Write the Docs Portland 2019 <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/>`_. We hope you're getting excited – we certainly are! It’s shaping up to be another wonderful year full of great conversations and interesting talks.

Today we are announcing our `Call for Proposals <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/cfp/>`_
and `website <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/>`_.
Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with our inspiring community of documentarians.
If there is something you’d really like to see a talk on this year, submit a proposal on it, or refer someone else who would be good!

Call for Proposals
------------------

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
We're looking for ideas and use-cases from all disciplines and roles, so whether you're a technical writer, developer, UX designer, community manage, or support professional who cares about content and communication, we want to hear from you!

You can read our full `Call for Proposals <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/cfp/>`__ on the website.
The Call for Proposals will be open until **Midnight PST January 17, 2019**.

Tickets
-------

Tickets will officially go on sale in **January 2019**.

In the meantime, you can see the ticket prices on our `Tickets <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/tickets/>`_ page.
As with the previous years, we have tiered pricing to make it fair for everyone. Please buy the ticket that best fits your situation.

As always, we keep ticket prices low so that it is accessible to the widest range of people possible. However, if you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend, please email us at portland@writethedocs.org, and we can see how we can help.

We will also open a call for volunteers and organizers soon, both of which are great opportunities to get involved with the community and also receive a free ticket.
