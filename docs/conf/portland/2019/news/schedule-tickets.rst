Announcing Full Schedule, Live Streaming, and Tickets Sold Out
==============================================================

Hello everyone!
We're about a month out from the Portland conference and we hope you're getting ready!
We're writing today to announce the full presentation schedule and to give you the latest registration update.

In the meantime, if it's your first Write the Docs, now's a great time to check out `the Welcome Wagon page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/welcome-wagon/>`_, which is packed with info to help you get oriented.
And whether it's your first or fifth conference, it's never too early to check out the `Explore Portland
<https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/visiting/>`_ page for inspiration on how to make the most of your visit.

Tickets are sold out
--------------------

Every year we see more enthusiasm from the community, and we are grateful for your support! Tickets are now **sold out** and we are at maximum capacity.

We have a waiting list on our ticket website where you can register in case of cancellations, but we usually don't have a high rate of cancellations so please do not book travel unless you have a ticket.

There are still spaces available in the Saturday hike, so if you want to join us `register for the hike now <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/tickets/>`_!

And if you are a member of an underrepresented group, the application for `diversity scholarship tickets <https://diversitytickets.org/en/events/415/>`_ is still open until **April 15th**.

Live streaming
--------------

After last year's successful pilot, we're happy to announce the return of the live stream! If you can't attend for any reason, we will be broadcasting all the main stage presentations.

Bookmark the `live streaming <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/livestream>`_ page, which will be updated on the morning of the conference with the embedded streaming viewer.
In the meantime, you can join the #live-streaming channel on Slack to connect with other remote attendees, ask questions, and troubleshoot technical issues with the stream.

Full presentation schedule
--------------------------

The conference website is now updated with the `talk schedule <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/schedule/>`_ for the main stage presentations, so you can start planning your time (and getting excited!) for the conference.

As always, we'll be running the `unconference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/unconference/>`_ downstairs in Lola's room, and `lightning talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/lightning-talks/>`_ each day after lunch.

You'll be able to sign up for unconference sessions and lightning talks during the conference.

Start thinking about Writing Day
--------------------------------

Our pre-conference `Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/writing-day/>`_ will happen on Sunday at the Crystal Ballroom.
We've got a couple of projects on the docket – including our annual 'Write Write the Docs' sprint on the community website.
But the day is much more fun when folks come with their own projects in mind!

If you have a project or are part of a community that you think would benefit from a writing sprint, start brainstorming now about what you might want to focus on.
If you'd like us to include your project on the Writing Day page, drop us an email at `portland@writethedocs.org <mailto:portland@writethedocs.org>`_.
Or just show up on Sunday ready to introduce your project!

Childcare reminder
------------------

If you are traveling with children to the conference, remember that you can register for free childcare provided by `DivCare PDX <https://www.divcarepdx.com/>`__. In order to plan capacity, the deadline to register is **April 22nd, 2019**. Please email us at portland@writethedocs.org to request one of the limited spots. We hope this effort will help more of our lovely documentarians to attend the conference!

Thanks so much for all your support and enthusiasm so far – we're so excited to see you all next month!

The Write the Docs team
