Get Started with AsciiDoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writing Day sponsor Asciidoctor will maintain a presence throughout the day, eager to support documentarians interested in creating great docs with the Asciidoc markup language. Whether you're already passionate about open source, eager to add a valuable skillset, or just curious, experts in documentation platform development and technical writing with AsciiDoc will be available for tutoring, workshops, and demos:

**Play with AsciiDoc**

You do not have to come with a mission or any sense of commitment. Come to Writing Day, let us learn what you're up to and maybe show you some stuff.

**Convert your docs or get started with AsciiDoc**

Take advantage of AsciiDoc consultants and practitioners to get a head start on migrating to AsciiDoc-based tools or just kick-start a project.

**Learn docs-as-code basics**

We reaize not every documentarian has a firm grasp of the docs-as-code approach, what makes it special, and the basic technical hurdles, such as understanding dynamic markup, using code editors, and managing source code with Git. Asciidoctor volunteers are happy to bring you up to speed on the broader docs-as-code approach, even if you don't already have an interest in AsciiDoc. We will meet you at your level and have exercises for learning the ins and outs of popular tools. 

We are maintaining a `GitHub project for all our Write the Docs programming <https://github.com/DocOps/wtd2019>`__. We would love to engage with you there, get feedback on our ideas, and hear how we can make Writing Day more successful for you!


Make Microsoft Docs More Inclusive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make our Microsoft Docs more inclusive; focusing on underrepresented groups and gender neutrality.

TensorFlow.org
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TensorFlow.org [https://www.tensorflow.org] is Google's open source machine learning platform and one of the most popular projects on GitHub. The website documentation is the primary way that developers learn about TensorFlow and, many times, their first experience with machine learning and AI.

Technical docs are pulled from GitHub [https://github.com/tensorflow/docs] so you'll need a GitHub account. Markdown experience helps, as well as basic familiarity with Jupyter notebooks [https://jupyter.org/] (since many of the guides [https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/tutorials/quickstart/beginner] can be run and edited in the browser [https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r2/tutorials/quickstart/beginner.ipynb] using Colab). API reference docs [http://bit.ly/ml4all-docs-sprint] are built from Python docstrings in the TensorFlow source code [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow].

Read the TensorFlow documentation contributors guide [https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs] for workflows and set up. And if you have questions before Writing Day, feel free to ask on the TensorFlow docs mailing list [http://bit.ly/tf-docs-list] or the Gitter channel [https://gitter.im/tensorflow/docs].

Write CockroachDB Docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CockroachDB is the SQL database for building global, scalable cloud services that survive disasters.. Here’s a quick overview video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgXiMcbGwzQ

Here are a few ways you can contribute to the CockroachDB docs:

**Test our docs**

Give us feedback about clarity, correctness, helpfulness, and ease-of-use by:

- User testing our `Search <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues/4773>`__
- User testing our `Authorization docs <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues/4774>`__

**Improve our current docs**

If you love fiddling around with a new product, you can:

- Improve existing docs by `adding missing details <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Awtd-writing-day+label%3AT-missing-info>`__ or `correcting errors <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Awtd-writing-day+label%3AT-incorrect-or-unclear-info>`__
- `Fill gaps <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AA-general+label%3Awtd-writing-day>`__ in our existing docs. If you’d like to dig deeper, we’re missing docs on a handful of important features.
- `Make an easy edit <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Awtd-writing-day+label%3Awtd-easy-first-issue+>`__. This is great for those who want to try Git and open their first PR.

Note: Our docs live in `GitHub <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs>`__, so you'll need a GitHub account.
