Press Kit
=========

We love that you're supporting Write the Docs by writing about the conference, sharing news about it on social media, telling people you're planning to attend.
We're trying to make it as easy as possible for you to do any of the above, so here are some sample tweets, useful information, and handy images you can use.

Sample tweets
-------------

Use these unedited, or tweak them as needed!

Images and logos
-------------------

We're working on getting our new logos and images up here, in the meantime you can use any of the Creative Commons licensed images from our `Flickr gallery <https://www.flickr.com/photos/writethedocs/>`_ or take a look at the `logo and other assets stylesheet <https://github.com/writethedocs/resources/>`_.

In particular, we encourage you to use these three photos in your tweets and blog posts, which we think are especially representative of Write the Docs Portland.
