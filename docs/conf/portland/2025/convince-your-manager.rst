  SUBJECT: Professional Development: Documentation Community Conference

  I'd like to attend Write the Docs {{city}}, which takes place {{ date.main }}. This three-day event explores the art and science of documentation, and covers a diverse range of topics related to documentation in the software industry.

  Write the Docs conferences bring together everyone who writes the docs – Tech Writers, Developers, Developer Relations, Customer Support – making the events an ideal networking opportunity.
  Each conference successfully combines a number of different event formats to deliver engaging, practical, and timely content.

  There is a single track of talks, a parallel unconference event, and a community writing day. The `sessions from last year </conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{year-1}}/speakers/>`_ will give you a good idea of the kinds of topics covered, many of which are relevant to my work.

  Costs:

  * Conference ticket - {{tickets.corporate.price}}

  Benefits:

  * Discovering solutions to problems I'm facing at work
  * Exposure to the latest ideas, techniques, and tools for software docs
  * Opportunity to learn from the best doc teams in the industry
  * Building professional connections with other documentarians

  Thanks in advance,
  [your name]

Corporate Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When discussing how to pitch the conference, a few generally helpful tips emerged:

* Highlight a few specific talks that relate to ongoing projects at work. (This one's dependent on pitching after the talk line up has been announced).
* If your company is looking to hire another documentarian, the job fair and networking at the event are an excellent resource.
* Don't forget that one of the benefits to your attendance is that it raises the visibility of your company in the community. If your team wants a reputation for caring about their docs, having people at Write the Docs is a great way to do that.

In addition, it can be useful to share some info about previous conferences. View the `main page overview </conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/#schedule-overview>`_ explaining what is Write the Docs, history and schedule overview.

  SUBJECT: Docs hackathon: Documentation Community Conference

  I'd like to attend Write the Docs {{city}}, which takes place {{ date.main }}. This three-day 
  event explores the art and science of documentation, and covers a diverse range of topics 
  related to documentation in the software industry. I am particularly interested in Writing Day, 
  I believe this event can positively impact our project and community.
  
  Writing Day is a community event modeled after the concept of “code sprints” or “hackathons”, 
  which are common in open-source conferences. The idea is to get a bunch of people together 
  and have them work towards a shared goal, in this case the goal is creating or improving 
  documentation or other related projects.

  Costs:

  * Conference ticket

  Writing Day Benefits:

  * Introduce our project and community to a new audience and demographic in our industry
  * Get highlighted as a project in the conference blog and announcements (`Submit online <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/news/call-for-projects-writing-day>`_ by *March 28, 2024* to be included)
  * Onboard documentation enthusiasts to increase the likelihood of post-conference contributions
  * Strategically tackle documentation tickets and requests
  * Update existing documentation
  * Peer review new and existing documentation

  Conference Benefits:

  * Exposure to the latest ideas, techniques, and tools for software docs
  * Opportunity to learn from the best doc teams in the industry
  * Building professional connections with other documentarians

Bringing our project to Writing Day benefits us as a community. It gives us the opportunity to 
improve our documentation and create a more inclusive project. Check out the `Call for Projects <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year }}/call-for-projects-writing-day>`_ for more information.

  Thanks in advance,
