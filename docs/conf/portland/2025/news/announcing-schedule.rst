Announcing Our Conference Schedule
===================================

The {{city}} conference is just over six weeks away, and we're busy getting ready behind the scenes.

You've already seen our list of awesome speakers; now we're announcing our :doc:`full conference schedule </conf/portland/{{year}}/schedule/>` so you know when they will be presenting!

Speaker Schedule
----------------

The website is updated with the :doc:`schedule </conf/portland/{{year}}/schedule/>` for the full conference, including main stage speaker talks, so you can start planning your time (and getting excited!) for the conference.

We'll continue to have a moderated Q&A session after each speaker. You'll have a chance to ask our speakers questions after the talk via our wonderful set of moderators. Virtual attendees can ask questions using the same QR code as folks attending locally.

Virtual Conference Tickets
--------------------------

Interested in listening to the Speaker Talks in real time but unable to attend in person? This year, we are excited to have added a Virtual Ticket option. View more about :doc:`attending virtually here </conf/portland/{{year}}/virtual/>`. All in-person tickets also receive access to watch virtually as well.

Start Preparing For Writing Day
-------------------------------

`Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/writing-day/>`_ happens on Sunday, the opening day of the conference. Itâ€™s a valuable opportunity to bring interested individuals into the same room, sharing their passions and aspirations while collaborating to develop creative solutions to solve a problem or issue.

**There are two ways to participate in Writing Day:**

- Lead a project: Attendees bring ideas, content, or OSS projects to work on with contributors.
- Contribute to a project: Attendees participate in various content projects.

Are you interested in leading a Writing Day project? We highly encourage you to `submit your project here <{{writing_day.url}}>`_. As always, you are welcome to show up on Sunday and introduce your project then!

Events and Activities
---------------------

Write the Docs is more than a conference. In addition to Speaker Talks, Writing Day, Unconference, and Lightning Talks, we offer additional activities for our attendees to enjoy, connect, engage in discussions, and meet new people.

* **Saturday Hike:** Join us for the hike in the amazing Forest Park, the largest urban forested park in the country. We'll be hiking along a beautiful creek and start at Lower Macleay Park at 2 PM. Please register a `free hike ticket <https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-{{shortcode}}-{{year}}/with/hike-ticket>`_ so we can contact you with any last minute weather and logistics information.
* **Sunday Welcome Reception:** Join us for our evening conference reception. This is a great chance to meet other attendees, get your badge (if you don't have it yet), and familiarize yourself with the venue. Drinks and snacks provided by us.
* **Monday Conference Party**. On Monday night we'll be hosting a social event off-site at `Jupiter NEXT <https://www.jupiterhotel.com/>`_, 900 E Burnside St, 2nd floor. This is a great chance to get to know more folks in the community and have a drink or two on us. Non-alcoholic options and snacks also provided. Event is 7-9 PM.
