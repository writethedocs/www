[Buy your ticket](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/tickets/)

### Pre-Conference Speaker Discussions 

We're excited to announce that we will be hosting three pre-conference discussions with a few of our speakers. These will be hosted by Joe Meersman, who managed the Unconference last year. 

These virtual discussions offer a chance to listen to our speakers and gain insight into their topics and perspective.

These will be March 18, 24, and April 1 at 12:00pm PST. More information coming soon!

### Virtual Conference Tickets

Can't attend our Portland conference in person? We've added a virtual ticket option, which includes:
- Livestreaming for all talks and Q&A sessions on the main stage
- The ability to submit live Q&A questions using Slido
- Virtual chats so you can network with other remote attendees

Check out our [tickets page](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/tickets/) to get yours!

### Writing Day Project Submissions Open

Our Writing Day Call for Projects is open. If you're interested in leading a project, we *highly* encourage you to submit your project ahead of time. This is a great way to build momentum and prepare attendees to show up ready to contribute to your project. 

[Submit your project](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeHMZ1uXTfnT0HMm-KfsgxYV1w3tmS7bMPtBx4H9cktJpSrdg/viewform?usp=dialog)

All projects submitted by April 23, 2025 will be included on our website. 

### Website Resources

If you haven't taken a moment to look through our website, we have updated our [Venue](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/venue/) and [Attendee Guide](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/attendee-guide/) pages. These provide helpful information about the conference layout, accessibility, and general FAQs.

We're excited to see you in May!
