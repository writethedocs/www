### Pre-Conference Speaker Discussions 

We're excited to announce that we will be hosting three pre-conference discussions with a few of our speakers. These will be hosted by Joe Meersman, who managed the Unconference last year. 

These virtual discussions offer a chance to listen to our speakers and gain insight into their topics and perspective.

These will take place on March 18, 24, and April 1 at 12pm PST. More information coming soon!

### Virtual Conference Tickets

We are looking at how we handle in-person and virtual conferences going forward, and are planning to test out a virtual ticket for Portland this year. As part of this, we're looking at perhaps bringing an hybrid conference back in Europe, but haven't firmed up any details there.

The virtual ticket option includes:

- Livestreaming for all talks and Q&A sessions on the main stage
- The ability to submit live Q&A questions for speakers
- Virtual hallway track and chat so you can network with other remote attendees

Head to our [Tickets page](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/tickets/) to get your virtual ticket.

### Writing Day Project Submissions Open

Our Writing Day Call for Projects is open. If you're interested in leading a project, we *highly* encourage you to submit your project ahead of time. This is a great way to build momentum and prepare attendees to show up ready to contribute to your project.

### Website Resources

If you haven't taken a moment to look through our website, we have updated our [Venue](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/venue/) and [Attendee Guide](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/attendee-guide/) pages. These provide helpful information about the conference layout, accessibility, and general FAQs.

We're excited to see you in May!
