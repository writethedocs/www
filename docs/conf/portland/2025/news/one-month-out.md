## Join our Slack Community

Our Slack network is the best way to connect with our community. Visit our [Slack info page](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/) to join and explore a list of our channels.

### #wtd-conferences channel
Our [#wtd-conferences](https://writethedocs.slack.com/archives/C1AKFQATH) channel is the primary space for virtual communication during the conference. We *highly* recommend you view and join the discussion before the conference!

- [Slack Canvas](https://writethedocs.slack.com/docs/T0299N2DL/F06BQAVNSH3) - we just added a canvas to the top of the channel, which provides links for key info, schedule, FAQs, and more. We'll keep this updated as the conference nears. 

**Reminder**: There is a two-step process to join Slack. You need to complete a short signup form before you can create your account.

## How Do I Participate in the Conference? 

There are a number of ways to engage in the conference. You can contribute to a Writing Day project, listen to Speaker Talks, facilitate an Unconference session, chat with our Sponsors, join us on the Hike, or become a volunteer!

View our [Attendee Guide](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/attendee-guide/) for strategies and tips on how to get plugged in and connect with others!

View our [Schedule](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/schedule/) page for exact times of the conference.

Additionally, we still have a couple volunteer shifts available. If you'd like to be a part of making the conference a success, complete the [Volunteer application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmogqirct-3eZyskVTDkx20406K3nRET78T2WSWEvz_fHPCQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) today.

## Travel Cancellation Policy

Unfortunately, international travel to the United States has become more complex for many in our community. If you need to cancel travel due to these circumstances, we will waive the 10% cancellation fee and offer a 100% ticket refund. Our [refund policy](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/tickets/#refund-policy) on our website has been updated to reflect this.

For those unable to attend in person, we offer a [virtual ticket option](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/tickets/) that provides access to view the main stage talks in real time. 

Your safety and wellbeing are our top priorities, and we support you in making the best decision for yourself. 

## Thanks to our sponsors

We are grateful to have the support of the following companies in 2025:
