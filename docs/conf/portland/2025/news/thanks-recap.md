# Portland 2025 Recap - Talk Videos, Photos, Sketchnotes, CoC Report

Hi everyone,

Our team is slowly emerging from the post-conference recovery period, and we wanted to send out a quick message to thank everyone for helping to make Write the Docs Portland 2025 such a success. We appreciate everyone who makes the conference possible: speakers, sponsors, organizers, volunteers, and attendees alike!

It was amazing to see everyone back at Revolution Hall in Portland, and the weather was just about perfect! 

## Conference recap

With **415 in-person attendees** and **170 virtual attendees**, this was our largest conference yet! We had the usual mix of talks on the main stage along with Q&A, lightning talks, Unconference sessions, writing day sprints, and a couple social events.

It was great to see the new Sunday registration, food carts, and the additional spaces in the venues being used. We will continue to work on improving the conference experience for everyone, and we appreciate all the feedback we've received already.

## Talk videos

**Talk videos are available now.** This includes all conference talks with Q&A, as well as the lightning talks. Our [Portland 2025 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZAeFn6dfHplMbtJtidqFFtL7rt3ASNSR) has all the videos.

Thanks again to all our presenters, emcees, and folks who asked wonderful questions!

## Conference photos

The conference photos are almost all uploaded and edited. Our [2025 Portland Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/writethedocs/albums/72177720325861452/) has over 100 photos, thanks to our wonderful photographer [Kay](https://www.instagram.com/goatladykay/)! 

We really love the photos each year, and you're welcome to use them for non-commercial purposes, such as conference write-ups, as per our [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/).

## Talk sketchnotes

The Sketchnotes for each talk from the conference are available on our [2025 Sketchnotes Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/writethedocs/albums/72177720325990264). Thanks to our talented sketchnote artist [Dennis](https://dennissdawson.wixsite.com/mr--dawson/portfolio) for capturing the talks in such a creative way!

## Code of Conduct transparency report

As with any Write the Docs event, this conference was covered by our [community Code of Conduct](https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/). We aim to be as transparent with CoC incidents and enforcement as we can.

To ensure that our CoC was visible and accessible, we took a number of specific steps:

- Every participant agreed to the Code of Conduct in advance during registration.
- The CoC, or a summary, was included on the conference website and around the venue.
- The CoC was repeatedly mentioned in our conference introduction and announcements.
- We specifically stressed that the CoC applies to all conference spaces, including the social event.
- We encouraged all attendees to report any incident, even if they were not sure whether it was a violation.

We had 1 report of a CoC incident at the conference:

- An attendee at the social event reported that they were approached by another person without a badge who made them uncomfortable, and made some inappropriate comments. This happened outside of the social event space, but we believe this person was a conference attendee. This event was reported the next day, and no further action was taken, given that we didn't have a clear identity of the person who made the comments.

Attendees can always report incidents, even after the conference, by emailing us at [conduct@writethedocs.org](mailto:conduct@writethedocs.org).

## Come to our upcoming events

We have 3 conferences coming up later this year:

- [Kenya 2025](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/kenya/2025/), June 7, 2025, **Nairobi, Kenya**
- [Berlin 2025](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/berlin/2025/), October 27-28, **Berlin, Germany** and **Virtual - CEST**
- [Australia 2025](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2025/), November 20-21, **Virtual - AEDT**

We're excited about a return to in-person events in Europe, which we haven't done since 2019. Kenya is in its second year, and Australia is going back to a virtual event to be more inclusive for 2025. We hope to see you at one of our other events!

## Thanks again

The conference is possible only because folks like you make it a great experience. Thanks for making it another wonderful year. Whether you were able to come out this time or not, we hope to see you again next yearâ€”or even sooner at one of our other events!
