Announcing Write the Docs {{ city }} {{year}}
===========================================

We're excited to already be able to announce the dates for our Portland 2025 conference!
Block those calendars off now!

**Write the Docs {{ city }} {{ year }} will be on {{ date.short }}**

We'll be back at Revolution Hall for another year,
full of great talks, networking, and community building.

Call for Proposals
------------------

Every year, Write the Docs invites people from all across our community to come up on stage to share their insights and experience.
**We plan to launch our CFP later this year**,
and now is a great time to start thinking about topics to present!

You can always look at our `previous years' talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{ shortcode }}/{{ year - 1 }}/speakers/>`_ for inspiration.

Tickets
-------

Tickets will go on sale in {{ date.tickets_live }}.

**Ticket pricing will be the same as last year:**

* **Student or Unemployed Tickets**: *{{tickets.student.price}}*
* **Independent Tickets**: *{{tickets.independent.price}}*
* **Corporate Tickets**: *{{tickets.corporate.price}}*

We will be also be running our Opportunity Grants program again this year for those who need financial assistance to attend.
We also have many opportunities for volunteers who want to help make the conference happen and get a free ticket that way.
Note that you are not required to do volunteer tasks at the conference to be able to apply for an Opportunity Grant.

More details on these programs will be announced soon,
and will be similar to last year.

Sponsorship
-----------

We are working to revamp our sponsorship program for this year based on feedback from last year.
We will be announcing our new sponsorship levels soon,
but if you are already excited about sponsoring, reach out to us at sponsorship@writethedocs.org.

We're always open to customization or new ideas for our sponsorships.
