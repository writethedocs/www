## Monday Unconference Sessions Open

We're opening up the Monday Unconference sign-ups today! We're doing this because Unconferences are amazing ways to foster connection within our community, and we hope this gives more visibility to the earlier Monday slots. [Learn more about the Unconference here](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/unconference/).

For those who are new to Unconferences or nervous about what makes a "good" topic, we have a vast range of topics and vibes every year. If you need some inspiration, consider any of these:

- Have a tricky situation or question burning in you? Whether that's about language, technology, workplace dynamics, job hunting, etc., there's definitely others with the same issues in mind.
- Made something recently you'd love to share? Whether that's requesting critique or offering a tool to help your fellow documentarians, we welcome you to bring your laptop and offer a demo.
- Focused on building community? Some attendees put on recurring  sessions for LGBTQ+ groups, for neurodiverse groups, for job hunters, for folks in particular geographic regions, etc. If you've got a drive to set something up, we welcome that! 

And as always, sign-ups are welcome during the conference. 

## Monday Lightning Talk Submissions Open

We're also opening up Monday Lightning Talk submissions. Lightning Talks are a wonderful way to share an idea, concept, or piece of information you find interesting, in an informal five-minute talk. Similar to above, we hope that by opening up Lightning Talks early, this provides more time to ideate and to submit your talk before the conference. [Learn more about giving a Lightning Talk here.](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/lightning-talks/)

## Join our Slack Community

### #wtd-conferences channel
Our [#wtd-conferences](https://writethedocs.slack.com/archives/C1AKFQATH) channel is the primary space for virtual communication during the conference. We encourage you to join the discussion.

We'll be posting announcements in that channel throughout the conference. We also welcome attendees to engage with each other leading up to and during the conference in there, too!

Reminder: There is a Slack canvas at the top of the channel with helpful links, key info, schedule, FAQs, and more.

[Join the conversation!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdq4DWRphVt1qVqH8NsjNnS0Szu_NljjZRUvyYqR7mdc00zKQ/viewform) 


## FAQ

**Where do I check in?**

On Sunday, registration is at the 1st floor Box Office (by Martha's Cafe) and Monday/Tuesday on the 2nd floor outside the main auditorium.

**How can I stream talks?**

This conference has virtual and in-person ticket options. All in-person ticket holders will receive a login link for the virtual conference platform, where we'll be streaming main stage talks and Q&As live. This may come in handy if you can't be at the venue for part of the event.

**Do you cater lunch?**

No, we donâ€™t cater a full lunch, but we do provide morning and afternoon snacks, coffee, and tea all day. This year, we're excited to have two food carts serving lunch Monday and Tuesday in the parking lot, and there are a number of great restaurants within walking distance. View the [Visiting Portland](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/visiting/) page for more ideas.

**Do you have a place to store luggage?**

Yes, we do! Go to Registration and they will check your bags.

**Where should I go if I need a quiet space?**

Our Quiet Space is on the 3rd floor hallway. This is a less frequented area and also includes access to the balcony for distanced seating.

**Do you have a Lactation Room?**

Yes, visit Registration to get the location and code.

## Thanks To Our Sponsors

Thanks to our sponsors for supporting the conference this year. A number of them will be present on Monday and Tuesday. We hope you get a chance to talk with them while you're here.
