# Call for Proposals Reminder, Tickets, and Opportunity Grants

Happy New Year, fellow documentarians!

As we enter 2025, we're looking forward to Write the Docs Portland and sending some reminders to kick the year off. We hope you're planning to join us for the 2025 conference.

Today is mostly a reminder that we're accepting Talk Proposals until **January 21**. Opportunity Grants and Volunteer applications are still open as well. And of course, tickets are on sale!

## Submit your talk by {{ cfp.ends }}

You still have just over one week to submit your talk to the conference. Check out the [Call for Proposals page](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/cfp) for more details about what would make a great talk.

If you already have an idea but are having a difficult time getting your proposal together, you can always ask for talk feedback on the [Write the Docs Slack](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/). The community is here to help!

- Talk proposals are due by {{ cfp.ends }}.
- Everyone who submits will receive a response by {{ cfp.notification }}.
