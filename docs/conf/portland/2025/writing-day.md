# What is Writing Day?

Writing Day is modeled after the concept of “sprints” or “hackathons”, which are common in open-source software (OSS) conferences.

On the first day of the conference, Sunday, attendees are encouraged to bring and lead a project, or contribute to another attendee's project.

The primary goal is to bring interested individuals into the same room, sharing their passions and aspirations while collaborating to develop creative solutions to solve a problem or issue.

If you have a project, we encourage you to submit it before the conference! This is a great way to build momentum and get other attendees excited to participate in your project. We’ll open project submissions in February/March. As usual, day-of projects are always welcome too - you'll have the option to sign up onsite and announce it during Writing Day.

## Lead a Project

Leading a project at Writing Day is a wonderful opportunity to engage with documentarians from a variety of backgrounds, experience, and expertise. Their collective wealth of experience can upgrade your documentation and create a more inclusive project. This empowers all of us to work together to create opportunities for each other and bigger, better communities.

**Tips to create and lead a new project effectively:**

- **Provide a project overview with a specific focus or goals:** Your overview is a 2 minute pitch that describes your project and clearly defines a focus area or goal.
- **Pre-label tasks and issues:** Create a specific event label and label documentation tasks and issues. This empowers new contributors to find tasks that interest them.
- **Create a task filter:** This helps contributors find issues more easily and see which issues have been assigned.
- **Clear onboarding:** Ensure your ReadMe, contribution guidelines, or onboarding instructions are accurate and up to date.
- **Project experts:** We recommend having 1-2 project experts on your project. We love our developer advocates, community managers, and subject matter experts! You’re welcome to ask for virtual reinforcements from your community as well.
- **Flexibility and understanding:** Reminder that attendees may need additional info to be successful in onboarding to your project.
- **Submit your Writing Day before the conference:** Projects submitted by **April 17, 2025** are featured in our pre-conference blog post and email. Many attendees have shared that their curiosity for specific projects motivated them to attend. Project submissions open in February/March.

These are suggestions and not requirements. It is perfectly valid to show up to Writing Day, tell us about your project day of, and ask for attendee contribution! It’s been done before and it will be done again.

## Contribute to a Project


Writing Day is the perfect opportunity to participate and learn about new projects and technologies. You are welcome to stay with one project all day, or project hop. Do what feels right to you.

**Tips to contribute to a project:**

- **Regardless of your experience level, you are welcome here!** We're excited to have you. Even if you feel you lack the right skills, experiences, or have never attended an event like Writing Day before, you’ll be surprised at how much you can contribute.
- **Explore our guide to writing documentation!** Our [beginner’s guide](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/) is designed to help you get started and spark ideas for how you can contribute to a project.
- **Ask questions!** If you encounter challenges with new concepts and tools, you are in a room surrounded by friendly people from diverse backgrounds and experiences. You can always ask the Welcome Wagon or Registration staff and volunteers. We will help you connect with the right person!
- **View the project list.** Check out the projects that have been submitted in advance. Keep in mind that some attendees choose to announce their projects during Writing Day itself, so these projects might not appear on the list in advance.

**We're excited to have another wonderful Writing Day!**

## Project List

### Enhance Your Portfolio! Contribute to an Open Source Repository

Project organizer: Mike Jang, he/him.

While we've open sourced our enterprise [documentation repository](https://github.com/nginx/documentation), we've done something different. We've set up [Good first issues](https://github.com/nginx/documentation/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22) that do not require Git knowledge.

We love all types of contributions. Examples:

- We have not completed our move towards "sentence case" in our headings
- We are missing alternative text for a few of our screenshots

Of course, if you know Git, we also would love your contributions. 

If you're a technical guru, our Good first issues give you the chance to test our how-tos and tutorials! If you remember Manny Silva's [Docs as Tests](https://www.docsastests.com/), several of our Good first issues include testable procedures.

And we hope to have interesting swag!
