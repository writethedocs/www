# Social Events

Write the Docs is a a community conference,
which means a big part of the experience is meeting and getting to know other documentarians.
Along with the talks and unconference sessions,
we have a few social events planned to help you connect with other attendees.

This is a great chance to meet other attendees,
and make sure you know your way around the conference venue.

and chat about the conference in a relaxed atmosphere.
