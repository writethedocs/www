### Sam Wright (he/him)

Brooke, also known as Batman, is a long time attendee of Write the Docs in Portland and part of the Welcome Wagon since 2024. Hailing from Toronto, Ontario in Canada, Brooke works at FreshBooks in a documentarian role she created on her own.

### David Bastedo (he/him)

David is a support operations program manager based in Portland, Oregon. He works with support knowledge bases, documentation analytics, and customer help centers. David has attended Write the Docs since 2016 and has been a part of the Welcome Wagon since 2019.

### Janine Chan (she/her)

#### Communications Coordinator

![](/_static/img/2024/team/janine.jpg)

Janine is a documentation nerd up in Canada. She feels so lucky to help organize at Write the Docs so she can nerd out in Portland too! She spends her time putting a lot of effort into complex documentation to make it look like it was easy all along, thinking about making inclusion efforts concrete, running unimpressive distances at unimpressive speeds, hiking, knitting, and swing dancing, albeit non-simultaneously. Her cat remains staunchly uninterested in all of this.

### Jennifer Rondeau (she/her)

##### Unconference Co-coordinator

![](/_static/img/2024/team/jennifer.jpg)

Jennifer helps write docs and microcopy for MinIO (object storage). She's been helping out in the Write the Docs community off and on ever since she attended her first conference in 2014, and is happy to be back behind the scenes. When she manages to resist the allure of docs content, tooling, and community, she dances argentine tango and works with local women's health initiatives.


### Jerome Villegas (he/him)

#### Emcee

### Jodie Putrino (she/her)

#### Emcee

Jodie manages the NGINX DocOps team at F5. A longtime attendee of Write the Docs, she loves being able to give back to the community that has given her so much. Outside of work and the wild world of conference organization, Jodie can be found playing in the Colorado mountains, making tasty food, or enjoying live music with her family.

### Mo Nishiyama

Otherwise, he works on game or tooling projects, some light woodworking, and land improvement projects on his homestead in southern Michigan. Warning: Ask him about UX in games, and he may talk your ear off.
