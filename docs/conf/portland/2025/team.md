### Emcee

Janine is a documentation nerd up in Canada. She feels so lucky to emcee at Write the Docs so she can nerd out in Portland too! She spends her time putting a lot of effort into complex documentation and making it look like it was easy all along, advocating for concrete actions to improve diversity, running unimpressive distances, hiking, and knitting. Her cat remains staunchly uninterested in all of this.

## Jerome Villegas (he/him)

### Emcee
