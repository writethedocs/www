# Attendee Guide
The Attendee Guide provides conference information and gives strategies and tips for all attendees (new and experienced) to get plugged in and connect with others! We‚Äôve gathered info here that will help you navigate the conference like a pro and make you feel more at home.

## Where Can I Ask a Question?

Go to our **Registration** table! There will always be a member of our Welcome Wagon Team stationed here and available during all conference hours. 

Whether you have a question about the schedule, where to eat, or how to connect with other attendees, they are your go-to for conference questions. If they don‚Äôt know the answer, they‚Äôll find someone who does!

## Welcome Wagon Tours

Join us for an introduction to Write the Docs. We‚Äôll go on a short tour of the venue and review information about the conference. While tours are designed to give first-time attendees all the information they need to feel comfortable at the conference, returning attendees often find them helpful as well. This gives everyone a chance to meet someone new. Bring any questions you may have!

Welcome Wagon Tours are scheduled for:

- **Sunday** - meet on the 1st floor at Registration by Martha's Cafe
  - 11:50am - Before lunch
  - 1:30pm - After lunch
  - 4:30pm - Before the Welcome Reception

- **Monday** - meet on the 2nd floor at the Registration table
  - 8:15am - Before the conference starts

## Food and Drinks

## Dress Code
We don‚Äôt have one! Portland is a casual-dress city and so is the Write the Docs conference. 
- You‚Äôll be meeting business colleagues at this conference, though, so neat and comfortable are good dress guidelines.
- Bring layers! Weather is on average high 65¬∞F (18¬∞C), low of 48¬∞F (8¬∞C), rainy, and partly sunny.

## Tips to Have a Great Conference

- Join the Write the Docs [Slack](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/)! This is the main way for attendees to stay connected, make plans, and ask questions during the conference. This requires you complete a sign up form so we highly encourage you sign up *before* the conference begins. 
- Follow Write the Docs on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/18284823/admin/page-posts/published/), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/writethedocs.bsky.social), and [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@writethedocs).
- Attend a Welcome Wagon tour!
- Engage with other attendees, volunteers, staff, and speakers. Don‚Äôt forget to use Eric Holscher‚Äôs [Pac-Man Rule](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/) to leave room for others to join! The most important part of this conference (and *any* conference) is the people you meet. Set a goal for yourself to meet a few new people.
- Review the [Speaker Schedule](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/speakers/) and choose which talks you want to attend the most. Spread out your time between talks, unconference sessions, networking, and breaks.
- Check the [Unconference](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/unconference/) schedule regularly (this will be shared during the conference). People add new sessions all the time.
- Give yourself and your brain a break! Conferences are exhilarating, but can also be exhausting. Grab a spot in the Sunset Room or take a quick walk.
- Eat! There will be snacks available inside the conference but there are many restaurants close by.
