# Venue

## Revolution Hall

1300 SE Stark Ave
Portland, OR 97214

Our conference will be held at Revolution Hall, a beautiful venue located in the thriving inner east side of Portland. It was originally a high school, and was converted into the versatile space it is today, including an 800+ seat auditorium, coffee shop, bar/restaurant, rooftop bar, rooms to support events, and local businesses. The venue still has some lockers in the hallway for that extra ambiance.

## Driving and Parking

If you drive to the conference, note that the venue does not have parking onsite. There is street parking east of the venue (15th Ave. and higher street numbers) and allows for all-day free parking. Additionally, there is 1-2 hour street parking directly around the venue. 

Bus transit stops are located near the venue. All transit in Portland announce major stops verbally in English, and most buses have a visual display of upcoming stops. Refer to the [Visiting Portland page](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/visiting/) for more information on public transportation.
