Concept
=======

Write the Docs {{ city }} is a
**three day conference** held on {{ date.short }} focusing on documentation systems, tech writing
theory, and information delivery.

Writing and maintaining documentation involves a multidisciplinary
community of technical writers, designers, librarians, typesetters, developers,
support teams, marketers, and many others. This group of people can be
collectively referred to as "documentarians".

**Write the Docs** creates a time and a place for this community to
share information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve the art
and science of documentation.

Demographics
============

Our audience is primarily from companies in the software industry.

Each conference we sell:

* 70% Corporate tickets
* 20% Independent tickets
* 10% Student tickets

Each conference is attended by:

- Technical Writers (60%)
- Developers (10%)
- Support Staff (10%)
- Managers (10%)
- Community Contributors, Enthusiasts & Other Folks (10%)
