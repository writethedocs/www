######################

Introduction
============

Welcome to the Write the Docs {{ city }} {{ year }} sponsorship prospectus.
We're excited to work with the organizations in our community to build the best documentation event in {{ year }}.
Created in 2013 in Portland, Oregon, WTD has hosted conferences around the world in Prague, Berlin, Sydney, London, and Melbourne.

Concept

Writing and maintaining documentation involves a multidisciplinary
community of technical writers, designers, librarians, typesetters, developers,
support teams, marketers, and many others. This group of people can be
collectively referred to as "documentarians".

**Write the Docs** creates a time and a place for this community to
share information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve the art
and science of documentation.

Demographics
============

Our audience is primarily from companies in the software industry.

Each conference we sell:

* 70% Corporate tickets

* 10% Student tickets

Each conference is attended by:

- Technical Writers (60%)
- Developers (10%)
- Support Staff (10%)
- Managers (10%)
- Community Contributors, Enthusiasts & Other Folks (10%)
