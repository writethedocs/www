Announcing speakers and talks
=============================

Hello everyone!

We're excited to announce that we've finalized our list of speakers for the Cincinnati event! Thank you to everyone who took the time to send us a proposal – we are grateful for your interest and could not have an event without you.

We also have some info about ticket purchasing (now's the time!), trip planning, and `sponsorship <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/sponsors/prospectus/>`_. Read on for details!

Speakers and talks
------------------

We look to bring a wide range of voices to the Write the Docs stage with a mix of practical, philosophical, and technical topics. Our partnership with Open Help means we were especially interested in talks with an open source angle, and fortunately we had a number of strong proposals related to documentation for open source projects. We're so excited about the presentations we've got for this inaugural event – we hope you are too!
