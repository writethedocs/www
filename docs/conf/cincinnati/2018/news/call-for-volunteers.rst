Announcing Call for Volunteers
==============================

The conference is now only a few weeks away! We hope you’re getting geared up for an exciting (and our first ever) Write the Docs + Open Help experience in Cincinnati, Ohio.

`Tickets <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/cincinnati/2018/tickets/>`_ are selling quickly – thanks to all who have already purchased a theirs!

If you're still debating whether to attend, check out the `Schedule <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/cincinnati/2018/schedule/>`_ page for the full list of presentations.

Call for Volunteers
-------------------

Each year, Write the Docs is lucky to have amazing volunteers, and the conferences wouldn't be such a success without them! Volunteering at our event only requires a few hours, and is a great way to meet the community...and of course you also get a free ticket to the conference!

**For Write the Docs + Open Help Cincinnati, we need volunteers to handle the registration desk on Saturday, August 18.**

If you're interested, send us an email at cincinnati@writethedocs.org. We only have a few openings for volunteers, and we will prioritize folks who will be attending for the first time, as well as folks who might not be able to attend otherwise.

Unfortunately, we cannot help with travel costs for volunteers, so please make sure that you are able to travel to the conference before you write to us.

Events and Activities
---------------------

As always, Write the Docs events are more than just talks. Every year we offer a wider range of activities that give our community members different ways to socialize, collaborate, and connect.

Check out what we have in store for you in Cincinnati:

- **Social Event.** Join us Saturday evening for a couple hours of socializing with fellow documentarians.

- **Underground Tour.** We arranged a private `Cincinnati Underground Tour <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/underground/>`_ after the unconference sessions close on Sunday. This is a separately ticketed event, and because of the logistics of running such a tour, we need to have a headcount early. `Register soon! <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/underground/>`_

- **Writing Sprints.** After the talks and unconference, we're hosting three days of Open Help `Doc Sprints <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/cincinnati/2018/sprints/>`_. This is an excellent opportunity to meet other documentarians, learn about and work on interesting documentation projects, and make yourself at home!

For the full schedule overview including start/end times for all activities, take a look at our `Schedule <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/cincinnati/2018/schedule/>`_ page.
