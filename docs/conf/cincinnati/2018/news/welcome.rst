Announcing Write the Docs + Open Help Cincinnati
================================================

Welcome to the official launch of `Write the Docs + Open Help Cincinnati 2018 <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/cincinnati/2018/>`_! We are excited to announce the first-ever collaboration between `Write the Docs <https://www.writethedocs.org/>`_ and `Open Help <https://conf.openhelp.cc/index.html>`_, coming August 18-22, 2018.

Since 2011, the Open Help Conference in Cincinnati featured attendee-led discussions and sprints for a wide range of people working on open-source and community-based projects. This year, Write the Docs and Open Help are coming together to bring 5 days of talks, conversations, and doc sprints a little closer to home for our East Coast and Midwestern documentarians!

Write the Docs + Open Help Cincinnati 2018 creates a time and place for the community of documentarians to learn, discuss, and do, working together to improve the art and science of documentation.

Here's a quick overview of the schedule:

* **Day 1: Talks on all things technical documentation.** We’ll have a variety of speakers on the stage sharing their experience and knowledge.
* **Day 2: Unconference discussion and open space.** Share ideas and discuss problems with others from the documentation community. Anyone can suggest and lead a session on any topic.
* **Days 3-5: Documentation sprints and writing days.** Get together with other documentarians to work on your docs and learn some new skills. Don't have a team to bring to the sprints? Join us anyway--get involved with an open source project and learn from the people who are pioneering documentation sprints.

Write the Docs + Open Help Cincinnati is scheduled for August 18-22, 2018 at `Union Hall <http://unionhallcincy.com/>`_ in the historic Over the Rhine neighborhood in `Cincinnati, Ohio <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Union+Hall/@39.109885,-84.515631,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x3caee5bfc65866b3!8m2!3d39.109885!4d-84.515631>`_.
