Updates on the Unconference and Underground Tour
================================================

Write the Docs + Open Help Cincinnati is less than a month away, and we've got some exciting updates for you.
But first, if you haven't already, check out our great
`speaker lineup <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/speakers/>`_, and
`buy your tickets <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/tickets/>`_ today.

Unconference Topics
-------------------

Our Cincinnati conference has a whole day dedicated to unconference sessions.
The sessions will be capped off with reports.
That way, everybody can learn from all the sessions, even if they can't attend them all.

Our unconference agenda is set by you!
You will have a chance to suggest and vote on sessions throughout the conference day on Saturday.
To help us and your fellow conference goers,
`list your topics <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/unconference/>`_
on our web site today.

Underground Tour
----------------

We've arranged a private
`Cincinnati Underground Tour <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/underground/>`_
after the unconference sessions close on Sunday.
This unique walking tour gives some history on Cincinnati's Over the Rhine neighborhood,
and takes you underground into 19th century crypts and brewing tunnels.
Our private tour will even include information on our venue,
which is no longer a part of the public tour.

This is a separately ticketed event, and costs $30 per person.
Because of the logistics of running such a tour, we need to have a headcount early.
`Register soon! <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/{{shortcode}}/{{year}}/underground/>`_
