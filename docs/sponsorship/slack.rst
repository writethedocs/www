Slack Network Sponsorship
=========================

Write the Docs is a community focused on all things related to software documentation.
Our :doc:`Slack network </slack>` is the beating heart of our community,
where thousands of documentarians hang out regularly to chat.
Sponsorship of our Slack network does two things:

* It allows us to cover the cost of moderating and managing our Slack community
* It allows you to get your name and message in front of our audience of :doc:`/documentarians`

You can join our Slack and read some of the messages to get a feel for the community.

Audience
--------

Our audience is made up of technical writers and decision makers in the software documentation industry.
The current Slack stats are:

* Over {{ slack_members }} users
* 100+ channels

The best idea of who is visiting our site is the information we have from our conferences.
Our audience is made up of:

.. include:: /include/demographics.rst

Sponsored entry format
----------------------

Sponsor copy will be posted to the ``#announcements`` channel in Slack,
which is joined by every user in our Slack.
It's used for community-wide announcements,
so your message will be very visible in the community.

The current format is:

* Up to 2 paragraphs of copy
* Up to 1 link in that copy - we generally recommend inline links, so that some of your text is linked, and the links will be expanded in Slack.

Content Guidance
----------------

The provided copy must respect our general `Slack
Rules <https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`__ and `Code of
Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__. 

With regards to the *No Sales-Y Content* rule, sponsored posts have an
exemption to the *No Direct Pitches*, *No links without context*, and
*No Brands* subrules. We would still ask that you review the *Be
Transparent* rule, as it is likely to improve the community reception of
your copy.

Write the Docs reserves the right to request changes to or reject copy
that violates the Slack Rules or Code of Conduct.

Schedule
--------

We currently allow 1 sponsored post per month on our Slack.
We aim to send these during the first week of the month,
but can be flexible if we haven't sold our current month.

Pricing
-------

The price for reaching our audience is **$350** per month.
