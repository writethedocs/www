Job Posting Sponsorship
=======================

We have added a new sponsorship opportunity for companies looking to hire documentarians.
It's a great way to promote your job to our community,
which is full of folks that are passionate about software documentation,
in particular around Docs as Code, API documentation, and developer experience.

This sponsorship includes: 

* A job posting in our monthly newsletter jobs section (Over {{ newsletter_subs }} subscribers)
* A highlighted job posting in our ``#job-posts-only`` Slack channel ({{ slack_members }} members)

Sponsored entry format
----------------------

The main goal here is to provide the company information, and a link to the job posting.
The format is:

* Company name
* Job title
* Job Location / Remote
* Salary (optional)
* Link to job posting

This will be used to create a newsletter entry, and a Slack post.

Schedule
--------

We publish the newsletter once a month, typically in the first week of the month.
The Slack post will be made within 1 week of the sponsorship being purchased.

Pricing
-------

The price for our hiring sponsorship is **$250** per job posting.
