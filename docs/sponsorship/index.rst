Community Sponsorship
=====================

We support our community in a variety of ways, and you can choose to focus 
your sponsorship on any one of them, at a level that suits you:

* Our conferences each have their own sponsorship prospectus
    - Our :doc:`Portland conference </conf/portland/2021/sponsors/prospectus>`
    - Our :doc:`Prague online conference </conf/prague/2021/sponsors/prospectus>`
    - Our :doc:`Australia & India online conference </conf/australia/2021/sponsors/prospectus>`
* Our :doc:`/sponsorship/newsletter` with over {{ newsletter_subs }} subscribers
* Our :doc:`/sponsorship/website` offers both logo sponsorships and advertising 

In addition to these existing programs,
we're always interested in working together with organizations in our community to build new approaches to sponsorship. 
We believe we have one of the most skilled and forward-looking communities in the software industry,
and look forward to working together to keep it sustainable.

You can `reach out to us`_ directly if you have any questions or ideas for sponsorship.

What your money supports
------------------------

Write the Docs was founded in 2013 to build a community for documentarians. There are many communities for particular technologies, or particular areas of writing. Write the Docs is quite unique in including everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and their users. That includes programmers, tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants people to have great experiences with software.

Over the years, we have grown to a community that includes:

* A Slack network with over 9,000 members.
* Yearly conferences on 3 continents, and video archives from all conference years.
* Meetups in almost 50 cities.
* A monthly newsletter with over 7,500 subscribers.
* A global job board for documentarian-friendly positions
* An extensive documentation guide.

We also run incidental activities, such as our recent salary survey, and are currently exploring even more ways to support the community and help our community stay connected.
