Newsletter Sponsorship
======================

Write the Docs is a global community focused on anything related to software documentation.
Our newsletter is our monthly update that includes community news, Slack conversation summaries, job postings, and sponsorship content.

Sponsorship of the newsletter does two things:

* It allows you to get your name and message in front of our audience of :doc:`/documentarians`
* It allows us to cover the cost of producing the newsletter for our community

You can see our newsletter archives to get a better idea of the content that we produce:
