Newsletter Sponsorship
======================

Write the Docs is a community focused on all things related to software documentation.
Our newsletter is a monthly update for all the folks in our community.
Sponsorship of the newsletter does two things:

* It allows us to cover the cost of producing the newsletter for our community
* It allows you to get your name and message in front of our audience of :doc:`/documentarians`

You can see our `newsletter archives </blog/archive/tag/newsletter/>`__ to get a better idea of the content that we produce.
