Meetups FAQ
===========

The following questions and answers cover some situations that you might
encounter when you want to `start a meetup <https://www.writethedocs.org/organizer-guide/meetups/starting/>`_.

Does Write the Docs cover the Meetup.com fees?
----------------------------------------------

Yes! We can cover the website fees for active meetups, or for new meetups on a trial-period basis.

New meetup groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to start a new meetup group but need assistance with the fees, please `contact us <mailto:support@writethedocs.org>`_ **before** you create the meetup group, so that we can create the group directly from the Write the Docs organization account. The trial period lasts for 3 months, which should give you enough time to establish a local presence and hopefully run your first meetup.

After 3 months, we will examine the state of the new meetup to determine the following criteria:

* **Whether the first meetup was well-attended and generated a potential for future meetups.** As a rule of thumb, an "active" meetup group runs at least 1 meetup per quarter (or 4 meetups per year).
* **How many members are in the meetup group.** The minimum number might change depending on where the meetup is located, but generally between 20-50 members in most major cities can be expected after the first 3 months.

Existing meetup groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already started a meetup group yourself and successfully ran several well-attended meetups, you can `contact us <mailto:support@writethedocs.org>`_ and we will take over the meetup fees. To transfer ownership of the meetup group, you use the `Step down as organizer <https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002882191-How-do-I-step-down-as-organizer->`_ process and nominate the Write the Docs account as new organizer. After the transfer, we will assign you the co-organizer role, which lets you have full control over the specific meetup group without handling finances or global operations.

Basic vs. Unlimited meetup subscriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Basic subscription allows your group a maximum of 50 members and 4 organizers, while an Unlimited subscription has no limits for members and organizers. If you anticipate less than 50 members for your meetup group, a Basic subscription may be suitable. If you anticipate over 50 members, an Unlimited subscription may be a better option.

Some Write the Docs meetup groups have started with the Basic subscription plan and have grown quickly. When the meetup exceeds 50 members, Meetup prompts the organizer to upgrade to the Unlimited plan. If you upgrade right away, you will not be charged at the Unlimited rate until your subscription renewal date.

Can a company sponsor a local meetup?
-------------------------------------

Yes, as long as the sponsoring company or organization adheres to the following guidelines:

* If a company wishes to host a meetup at their offices, the meetup must be open to all documentarians, regardless of whether they are employed at the host company.

* We recommend that companies handle their sponsorship contributions directly. For example, if a company wishes to sponsor equipment for streaming or recording talks, we advise that the company maintain the equipment and operate it during each meetup.

* Sponsorship contributions should be directly proportionate to the needs of the meetup. Our meetups are not-for-profit and also reflect the `Write the Docs worldview <https://www.writethedocs.org/organizer-guide/meetups/starting/#write-the-docs-worldview>`_. This means that aggressive recruitment techniques and other marketing-heavy actions during the meetup may be considered a violation of our `Code of Conduct <https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`_. However, an intro slide mentioning the sponsors, signs near refreshments or a mention by the organizer are all fine.

* If you have any questions regarding a specific sponsorship offer or request, please do not hesitate to `email us <mailto:support@writethedocs.org>`_ or ask a question in the #meetup-organizers channel on our Slack.

Meetup organizer benefits
-------------------------

We give each meetup organizer a 50% discount to all Write the Docs conferences as a way of saying thanks. If you haven't gotten your discount code and would like to buy a ticket, send an email to support@writethedocs.org. We also have organizer-specific sessions at conferences.

Organizing meetups also naturally builds your community organization and volunteer experience. These look great on your resume.

Sharing meetup duties
---------------------

The Meetup interface allows you to set up multiple organizers in a `Leadership Team <https://www.meetup.com/help/article/868703/>`_.

Different members of your leadership team can:

* Find speakers
* Set up meetup locations
* Handle meetup logistics, as described in `Starting a Meetup <https://www.writethedocs.org/organizer-guide/meetups/starting/>`_

If you need to put out a call for help, here's a generic letter that you can use.

If you have a Twitter account for your meetup, you can share access through `TweetDeck <https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/>`_.

Log in with your Meetup Twitter account, select the Accounts link (in the left hand navigation bar), and select Manage Team. You should be able to add the Twitter accounts of other organizers there.
