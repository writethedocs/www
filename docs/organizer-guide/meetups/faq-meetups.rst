Meetups FAQ
===========

The following list of questions and answers cover some issues that you might
encounter when you want to `start a meetup <http://www.writethedocs.org/organizer-guide/meetups/starting/>`_.

Can Write the Docs cover the Meetup.com fees?
---------------------------------------------

Yes! We can cover the website fees for active meetups, or for new meetups on a trial-period basis.

New meetup groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to start a new meetup group but need assistance with the fees, please `contact us <mailto:conf@writethedocs.org>`_ **before** you create the meetup group, so that we can create the group directly from the Write the Docs organization account. The trial period lasts for 3 months, which should give you enough time to establish a local presence and hopefully run your first meetup.

After 3 months we will examine the state of the new meetup group to determine the following criteria:

* Whether the first meetup was well-attended and generated a potential for future meetups. As a rule of thumb, an "active" meetup group runs at least 1 meeup per quarter (or 4 meetups per year).
* How many members are in the meetup group. The minimum number might change depending on which city/country the meetup is located, but generally between 20-50 members in most major cities can be expected after the first 3 months.

Existing meetup groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already started a meetup group yourself and successfully ran several well-attended meetups, you can `contact us <mailto:conf@writethedocs.org>`_ and we will take over the meetup fees. To transfer ownership of the meetup group, you use the `Step down as organizer <https://www.meetup.com/help/topics/19/article/465025/>`_ process and nominate the Write the Docs account as new organizer. After the transfer, we will assign you the co-organizer role, which lets you have full control over the specific meetup group without handling finances or global operations.

Can <company> sponsor a local meetup?
-------------------------------------

Yes, as long as the sponsoring company or organization adheres to the following guidelines:

* If a company wishes to host a meetup at their offices, the meetup must is open to all documentarians, regardless of whether they are employed at the host company.

* We recommend that companies handle their sponsorship contributions directly. For example, if a company wishes to sponsor equipment for streaming or recording talks, we advise that the company maintain the equipment and operate it during each meetup.

* Sponsorship contributions should be directly proportionate to the needs of the meetup. Our meetups are not-for-profit and also reflect the `Write the Docs worldview <http://www.writethedocs.org/organizer-guide/meetups/starting/#write-the-docs-worldview>`_. This means that aggressive recruitement techniques and other marketing-heavy actions during the meetup will be considered a violation of our `Code of Conduct <http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`_.

* If you have any questions regarding a specific sponsorship offer or request, please do not hesitate to `email us <mailto:support@writethedocs.org>`_ or ask a question in the #meetup-organisers channel on our Slack.
