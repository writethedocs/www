Starting a Meetup
=================

Write the Docs :doc:`/meetups/index` provide
a great way to connect and continue the conversations sparked by our
:doc:`/conf/index`, `slack channel
<http://slack.writethedocs.org/>`_ and `forum <http://forum.writethedocs.org/>`_ .
If you don't have a Write the Docs Meetup nearby, we can help you get one started.
With a little help, you can make it happen with a Meetup in your area!

Write the Docs Worldview
------------------------

Yes, Write the Docs has a worldview. It's inclusive and expansive. We welcome
everyone who is interested in creating great documentation that helps people
develop, use, and maintain products and services. Our community includes
technical writers, developers of all flavors, QA, product managers, support
engineers, designers, librarians, scientists, community managers, and more.

For more information about the Write the Docs worldview, see Eric Holscher's
Introduction to the conference and community from Write the Docs NA 2016:

Now for some details:

Launch your Group
-----------------


Before you get started, check out our :doc:`/organizer-guide/meetups/faq-meetups/`.

You can start a Write the Docs Meetup by using the `Meetup.com
<http://www.meetup.com/>`_ service. You can use the website or the mobile app to
create events, contact Meetup members, sp your sponsors, and more.

- For advice on running meetups, or questions not covered here or in the :doc:`/organizer-guide/meetups/faq-meetups/`, drop us a line in `#meetup-organisers <https://writethedocs.slack.com/messages/meetup-organisers/>`_ on Slack.
- For help with Meetup fees or technical issues, `email us <mailto:support@writethedocs.org>`_.

Create a Meetup Page:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to the `Meetup website <https://secure.meetup.com/create/>`_ and follow the instructions.

Tips:

* **Topics**: We want to include everyone interested in software documentation. Include topics that help publicize your meetups to the developers and engineers in your area, such as Python, JavaScript, APIs, Perl, Ruby, UX, User Experience, as well as standard topics associated with technical writing.
* **Name**: Our Meetup names follow a naming convention: such as "Write the Docs", for example, "Write the Docs PDX".
* **Members' name**: Our standard name for members is "Documentarian".
* **Code of Conduct**: Do include a code of conduct. For options, see the standard Write the Docs' :doc:`/code-of-conduct` or the abbreviated version used by `Write the Docs PDX <https://www.meetup.com/Write-The-Docs-PDX/pages/19618086/Code_of_Conduct/>`_

After you've started your Meetup, `add
it to the list <https://github.com/writethedocs/www/tree/master/docs/_data/meetups>`_
or `send us an email <mailto:support@writethedocs.org>`_ so we
can add your Meetup information to the :doc:`/meetups/index` list.

Find a Place to Meet
--------------------

Ideally, you can start by setting up a Meetup at your corporate facility.
If your own workplace isn't a good option for a meetup location, ask other local
documentarians or community managers for ideas. Where are other meetups held?
Conferences? Do you know someone who works for a likely sponsor or whose company
might be willing to host your meetup?

Ideally, you already know a sponsoring manager in a target company. It's easier
if you know a manager responsible for community relations.

Alternatively, the electronic version of cold-calling can help you find a
location. Try sending out an email like the example provided in the following template:

.. code-block:: jinja

    Hello,

    I am the organizer of Write the Docs {{ city name }} meetup {{ link to meetup page }}. Write the Docs
    {{ writethedocs.org }} is a global community of people interested in excellent documentation.

    We'd like your help! If you're interested in improving your documentation, help us. We'll provide
    a resource with different experiences, and potentially writers who can help with your documentation.

    If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

    Regards,
    {{ name }}

If your first attempts don't work, contact other tech companies in your town.
Post messages on job boards, tech conference websites, or on other tech Meetup
channels. If you attend a tech conference, visit sponsor booths to see whether
they are interested in sponsoring your meetup.

Alternative Meetup Locations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't limit your search to corporate locations. Several Write the Docs Meetups
have successfully met in cafes, libraries, restaurants, and colleges. Some
businesses might want to help in exchange for the revenue generated by members
during your events.

Sometimes, alternative locations are better for smaller groups. For example, one
of our groups has a regular `coffee klatch <http://www.meetup.com/Write-The-Docs-Seattle/events/231890982/>`_.


Find attendees, speakers, and topics
------------------------------------

Attendees:
~~~~~~~~~~

After you publish your meetup page, promote it! Here's a few suggestions to get started:

* Use your network: ask colleagues, friends, and contacts to promote the meetup.
* Attend other meetups. Tell them about Write the Docs.
* Add your meetup to local tech event calendars.
* Some communities look for meetups on Eventbrite.
* Some communities look for meetups on Linkedin
* Use social media. Several Write the Docs meetups publicize through Twitter (`example <https://twitter.com/WriteTheDocsPDX/>`_).
* Help your fellow Meetup leaders. Retweet their announcements.
* Announce your meetup on `Write the Docs Slack <https://writethedocs.slack.com>`_.
* Use the Meetup email list with your members.
* Blog about upcoming (and recent) meetups.



Speakers:
~~~~~~~~~

* Look for previous and future speakers at `Write the Docs conferences <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/>`__.
* Scan other conferences local speakers.
* Review other meetups and conferences for speakers of interest, in areas such as APIs, Agile, software languages, and more.
* Speakers are often willing to reframe their talks from a documentation point of view.
* Ask people at your meetups to do a talk.
* Invite different speakers to each Meetup. Repeat speakers are OK if it's been over a year.
* Invite speakers from different backgrounds and don't limit talks to writing.

  For example, you might want to invite someone who codes or leads a community in Python, Javascript, or
  Ruby, and ask them to share a project or approach to documentation specific to their domain. Or, invite an architect,
  editor, designer, user experience professional, or support representative to talk about their approach to documentation
  projects and problems.

Try different formats. Alternatives:

* Panels,
* `Round-tables <https://www.meetup.com/Write-The-Docs-London/events/231780773/>`_
* Lightning talks
* Workshops


Topics:
~~~~~~~

The following are examples of topics that have worked well for other meetups:

* API docs
* Contibuting to OSS
* Easy entry to OSS
* Navigating career path (different sectors of tech writing)
* Sketchnoting as documentation
* Hackathon -- creating docs “The lone writers guide”
* Howto Markdown (multiple methods)
* Best practices
* Pub socials

If You Can't Find a Local Speaker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you can't find a local speaker, consider screening a popular talk from one of the
`Write the Docs conferences <http://www.writethedocs.org/videos/>`_ and inviting the conference presenter to call in for
a live Q & A session. Both the Boulder and Austin meetups have done well with this format.

 * `So you need to document an API <https://www.meetup.com/Boulder-Denver-WriteTheDocs-Meetup/events/232962552/>`_

 * `Living documentation <https://www.meetup.com/WriteTheDocs-ATX-Meetup/events/231859187/>`_

If you choose this format (or have a remote speaker), make sure your meeting venue supports high quality video
presentation and audio conferencing.


You Don't Always Need a Speaker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is not always easy to find a speaker. Other meetups have done well with
alternatives:

* Coffee Klatches; suitable for meetups with a few people. The Seattle meetup has done well with this format.
* Pure networking meetup; you can "roundtable" a specific topic; give each attendee a chance to talk about what they do.

Starting and Running the Meetup
-------------------------------

* Greet everyone and help them feel welcome.
* Mention code of conduct.
* Introduce the meetup and the theme.
* Encourage folks to introduce themselves.
* Allow time for networking and questions.
* Help speakers get ready and set up AV resources.
* Use supportive language.


Joint meetup
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write the Docs shares interests with other meetups, such as

* APIs
* Agile
* Programming languages
* UI
* Content Strategy
* QA

You can set up topics of interest to multiple meetups.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Meetups don't always go according to plan. The following list summarizes some
of the problems that you might encounter with potential solutions:


What happens when your speaker cancels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a speaker cancels, think of it as an opportunity! While it's not convenient,
it's your chance to get others to participate. Here are three approaches:

1. Go around the "table". Ask each attendee to:

   a) Introduce themselves
   b) Cite one major problem they have. Make notes.
   c) After the introductions are complete, ask people to comment on each problem.

2. Talk to the attendees about future meetups

   a) Ask for speakers that a member knows
   b) Poll members about preferred future topics

3. You may have a regular attendee whose willing to do a talk at the last minute.


After Your Meetup
-----------------

* Send a thank you note to your speakers. Ask them to post their slides.
* Send a thank you note to your host.
* Post pictures on your meetup page. Be sure to get permission.
* Use Twitter to thank your attendees, speakers and sponsor.
