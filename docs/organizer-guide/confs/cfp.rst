Speakers and Call for Proposals
===============================

This section describes how to:

* Manage the CFP
* Select talks
* Wrangle speakers before/during/after the conference

CFP timeline
------------

The CFP should be scheduled to end around **3 months** prior to the conference.
This allows for time to book travel for speakers,
but also keeps the topics fresh and ensures the speakers are still passionate about them.

After the CFP ends,
reviews should be given 1 week to review all the talk proposals.
After this, we will have rate them following the below process,
and have the final group meeting where we talk through the final schedule

How to write a CFP?
-------------------

* **"Announcing [conf name] Call for Proposals":** Say hi and don't forget to mention when is the conference and when will close the CFP.
* **"Conference Goals":** Invite everyone who care about docs to contribute!
* **"Topic ideas":** To help potential speakers find a topic, list different subjects that make good talks. Add a few links to previous talks: it will help people get a better idea of what you want.
* **"Presentation format":** Format is 30 minutes but invite people to contact you if they want to do something longer/shorter.
* **"Speaker Benefits and Logistics":** Say if you cover ticket, travel cost and lodging for speakers.
* **"Question?":** How people should contact you.
* **"Submit a Proposal":** Link or form where people can send their proposal.

Talk review and selection
-------------------------

Talk proposals are reviewed by a panel of 4-6 people from the conference organization team. 
We use a tool called Grorg, which lets us store, review, and record our selections collaboratively.

Each member of the review committee will need:

* Creds for our Grorg instance
* 6+ hours of time for proposal review

Once the CFP has closed and we've pulled all the form entries into Grorg, folks can get started with their reviews. 
There's a place for a rating, as well as comments. 
We encourage our reviewers to avail themselves of both, since it makes for a much more productive review meeting. 

For the review itself, these are the guidelines we use. 

The practical stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Entering your scores in Grorg.** To score proposals, just click the 'View Applicants' button and then hit 'Score' next to the applicant's name. (You can use the 'Score Random Applicant' button too, for giggles.) 

**How we rate talks.** Please use the following rating system: 
   1 - I will argue strongly against including this in the program.
   2 - I'm not a fan, but it wouldn't be the end of the world if we included this.
   (3 - DO NOT USE. Three means you don't have an opinion. We don't believe you. No threes.)
   4  - This is a decent talk. I'd be cool with including it. 
   5 - I will fight to make sure this talk is included in the program. 

**Revisit your first ~15 talks.** When you're reviewing this many talks, it can take a while to get the feel of the rating system since, at first, you only have a small sample to compare to. To solve this problem, we recommend that, when you get to the end of your reviews, you go back and take another quick look at the first 15 or so talks you looked at, to make sure your rating holds up in the context of the whole pool. 

**The review meeting.** Once we've got everybody's ratings, we'll average them all out. At the review meeting, we'll look at not only the talks that floated up to the top, but also any that were particularly divisive (i.e., that garnered both 1s and 5s). 
Dealing with conflicts of interest. Basically, if you have a conflict of interest with a particular proposal, don't vote on it. This includes your own proposals.

The intellectual stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's really useful, when you're doing these reviews, to think not just about the things that you, personally, are most interested in, but also what talks are a good fit for the spirit of a Write the Docs conference. You've been before. You know the vibe. Try to keep that energy in mind when reading proposals and think about whether they would be at home in lineup of fun, educational, and often out-of-the-box speakers.

The other thing to consider is balance. One of the things that makes this process so hard how many different spectrums across which we need to balance our talks. Here are some of the ones we try to keep in mind: 
* Writers/Developers/Product/Support
* Gender
* Technical level
* Speaking experience
* Open source vs. not

It's not an exact science. Use your discretion and take lots of notes, come to the meeting ready to discuss. 

Sharing proposal decisions
--------------------------
We send emails out to everyone who submitted a proposal. 
They either get an acceptance, rejection, or waitlist email.
The templates for all of these are linked below.

Speaker Acceptance Template

   :language: jinja


Building a Schedule
-------------------

There are an infinite number of ways to arrange a schedule.
We've found it best to just randomly assign speakers to the schedule,
taking into account their availability (some folks can only speak on certain days).
After that,
you can shuffle speakers who you know are good to the following slots:

* Talk after lunch (should be high energy)
* Last talk of the day (should be memorable)

After this,
you send each speaker their time slot,
and confirm it works for them.
Give them a couple days to make changes,
then we can publish the schedule.

Biases
------

* New people
* Community members
* Previous lighting talk speakers
