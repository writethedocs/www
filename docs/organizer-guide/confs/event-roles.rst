Other Important Roles to Remember
---------------------------------

* **Proposal reviewers** 

  * In 2016 this group was expanded to include folks who weren't otherwise organizers, 
    and the process was streamlined. It's still time-consuming and intense, 
    because we try to decide pretty quickly after the CFP closes.

* **Shadow wrangler**

  * This role is similar to the volunteer coordinator role.
  * It is more relevant in the context of our remote conferences, which have made it challenging to recruit,
    onboard, and retain new volunteers.
  * This person recruits volunteers who are interested and committed to supporting the organizing team.
  * They ask volunteers to "shadow" organizers in order to learn how to perform their roles and step-in as needed.

* **Emcee** 

  * Historically this person hasn't necessarily been one of the main organizers 
  * Must be someone personable, with a calming tone and friendly stage presence 
  * Must understand how to keep things brief, and say "just enough" to keep the conference flowing
  * Must be comfortable with researching, preparing, and delivering speaker introductions
  * A knowledge of audio-visual equipment usage is helpful, but not mandatory.
