Emcee script
============

Based on the [WTD Bay Area emcee script](https://github.com/San-Francisco-Write-The-Docs/meetups/blob/master/planning/emcee%20script.md),
this is a general outline of the emcee script for use in virtual meetups. Each
emcee should feel free to customize the script and rely on it only as needed to
keep things natural without missing key info.
