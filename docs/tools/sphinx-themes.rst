Alabaster
---------

Based off the original Flask and KR themes,
this is a more extensible version of the prior.
It is what this site uses,
and provides very minimal markup.
It's great for text content where you just want to make the words front and center.

Sphinx Bootstrap Theme
----------------------

A basic Sphinx theme that uses Bootstrap for nice styling.
It is a great start for any site that uses Bootstrap,
or just wants a simple good looking theme.
