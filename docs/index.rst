Welcome to our community!
=========================

**Write the Docs** is a global community of people who care about documentation. Our primary gathering places are:

* :doc:`Our slack network </slack>` with thousands of members
* :doc:`Conferences </conf/index>` on 3 continents
   - :doc:`Portland 2022 </conf/portland/2022/index>`, **May 22-24**, Virtual - PST
   - :doc:`Prague 2022 </conf/prague/2022/index>`, **September 11-13**, Virtual - CET
   - :doc:`Australia 2022 </conf/australia/2022/index>`, **December 8-9**, Virtual - AEDT
* :doc:`Local meetups </meetups/index>` in over 40 cities

We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and
their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers,
tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants
people to have great experiences with software.

Our conferences create a time and a place for the global community of
:doc:`documentarians` to share information, discuss ideas, and work together
to improve the **art and science of documentation**.

Our :doc:`/code-of-conduct` applies to all our community spaces.
