Welcome to the Write the Docs Community
=======================================

**Write the Docs** is a series of conferences and local meetups focused on all things related to software documentation.

We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and
their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers,
tech writers, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants
people to have great experiences with software.

Our conferences create a time and a place for the global community of
:doc:`documentarians` to share information, discuss ideas, and work together
to improve the **art and science of documentation**.

Mailing Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have mailing lists for our North American and European Conferences.
They are low traffic,
and only send information about the conferences and Write the Docs events in those areas.

*North America*

*Europe*

Meetups
~~~~~~~

We have meetups in multiple cities every month. 
The :doc:`/meetups/index` page has more information.

Forum
~~~~~

Check out our `Forum <http://forum.writethedocs.org/>`__ to keep in
touch with your fellow documentarians.

The forum is the place to start discussions that we should keep around for a while. If a Slack conversation 
starts to get a lot of attention and seems like something of permanent interest, we suggest that you move it 
over to the forum.

Slack
~~~~~

You can join us on `Slack <http://slack.writethedocs.org>`_ to have real-time discussion and keep in touch with folks.

Slack conversations aren't archived, so we recommend either putting substantial items of interest on the forum, 
or moving them there if they develop into something bigger.
