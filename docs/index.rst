Welcome

Write the Docs is a place where the art and science of documentation can be practiced and appreciated. There are a lot of people out there that write docs, but there isn't a good place to go to find information, ask questions, and generally be a member of a community of documentarians. We hope to slowly solve this problem by building a place with high quality information about the art of writing documentation. Along with that, we hope to open communication between all the awesome people out there writing documentation.
