# One page contract

It is useful to set out expectations and terms in writing. This avoids ambiguity with the client.

## Consider

Clients may provide their own contracts. If they do not, it is sensible to provide your own. Think carefully about how effective you need the contract to be. The template provided here is a simple one-page contract. It ensures you have your terms in writing and clarifies expectations for both you and the client. However, if you need a document that you are confident is legally strong, consult a lawyer.
