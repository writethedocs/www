# Project planning

This page covers both planning when considering a new client or project, such as identifying project scope, and new client onboarding once you've agreed to work together.

## Consider before taking on a project

### Are there any key deadlines?

#### Example
"This a new project. v1.0 releases in three months. Documentation must be ready then."

### What are the deliverables?

#### Example
"The client needs documentation in both web and PDF formats."  
"The client has feedback from users that they'd really like video tutorials. We need to focus on producing these."

## Consider after taking on a project

### Who do I report to?

#### Example
"I am working as part of the engineering team, reporting to the lead developer."

### Who are the key stakeholders in this project?

#### Example
"My goal is to reduce support load, so I should work closely with the support team."

### Who are my reviewers?

#### Example
"I am documenting a complex API. I need the developers to review my work for technical accuracy."

### What tools do I need access to?

#### Example
"This client uses GitHub to manage their docs, and Netlify to deploy them. I need adding to the client's teams and access to their repos."
