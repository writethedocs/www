# Business identity

Your business identity is how you position yourself in the market, and your corporate personality. It should reflect your [core values](core-values.md), and underpin your [business plan](business-plan.md).

## Consider

### What type of clients do I want?

#### Example  
"I love the startup vibe."

[Core values > Where do I want to work?](core-values.md#where-do-i-want-to-work)  


### How do I present myself to the world / what is the tone of my interaction with clients?

#### Example  
"I want people to think of me as a polished professional."  
"I will adapt to each client's tone."

### What do I offer my client?

Think about your value proposition. Be specialized: the clearer you are about your speciality, the easier it is to find the right clients (and for them to find you). 

#### Example
"I offer a complete documentation service, from tooling and project management to writing. I will remove documentation effort from your dev and support teams."  
"I have a deep understanding of education and learning. I specialize in producing tutorials and e-learning materials. I will help your customers get the most out of your product."

### What tools do I specialize in?

#### Example  
"I am an expert in MadCap Flare."

### What is my elevator pitch?

This is two to three sentences summarising your business specialities, value proposition and and identity.

#### Example
"I'm a technical writer for software products. I reduce support load and increase customer loyalty by helping them use your product."  
"I run a women in tech blog and offer freelance writing services for tech companies. I focus on industry trends, SaaS and HR. I help my clients acquire new customers through content marketing."
