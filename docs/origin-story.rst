Origin Story
============

The story of how Write the Docs came to be has been told, but it's time to put it up on our own site.
The first documentation of the emerging documentarian community comes appropriately enough in the form of a `tweet`_ from early 2013:

What happened next is best told in the words of one of the founders,
Troy Howard.
He wrote it in early 2014,
before the second conference.
So read it,
and ponder just how far we've come since then.

History 
-------

We'll let `Troy <https://twitter.com/thoward37>`_ tell the `story <http://blog.thoward37.me/articles/developer-to-documentarian/>`_ from here:

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

Living in Portland, I'm lucky to be surrounded by some amazing people.
If you wander down to the `food
carts <http://www.foodcartsportland.com/>`__ on any given weekday at
lunch time, you're likely to run into any number of luminary 'people
from the internet' hanging around.

One of those people might be `Eric
Holscher <http://twitter.com/ericholscher>`__. I've known Eric since
2011, mostly as a `towering wookie-like
figure <http://flic.kr/p/eaGmjA>`__ with `killer ping-pong
moves <https://twitter.com/ericholscher/status/270709054115033088>`__
that is also an `insightful Python
developer <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2009/nov/10/what-they-didnt-teach-me-college/>`__.
I was vaguely aware of his side-project, `Read The
Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`__, which, `since
2010 <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2010/aug/16/announcing-read-docs/>`__
has been a vital resource to the Python open source community.

As a developer, I have always cared about documentation, but I'm not
sure I ever thought about it *deeply* until I got to know Eric Holscher
better. Sometime in early 2013, I ran into Eric at a local eatery, and
we started discussing Read the Docs. He had recently `left his job at
Urban Airship <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2013/jan/10/walk-woods/>`__
and was able to work on Read the Docs full time. This was going well,
but he was concerned about the future of the project. There didn't seem
to be a sense of community around documentation. Was documentation ever
going to be given the focus it needed?

At the same time, I looked around me and realized that here in Portland,
I was surrounded by some amazing people working with documentation;
`Noirin Plunkett <https://twitter.com/noirinp>`__, `Luc
Perkins <https://twitter.com/lucperkins>`__, `Leslie
Hawthorn <http://hawthornlandings.org/>`__, `Adron
Hall <https://twitter.com/adron>`__, `Joe
Moon <https://twitter.com/joebadmo>`__, `Eric
Redmond <https://twitter.com/coderoshi>`__. I saw a community that
didn't see itself.

Eric Redmond was the first person I'd met with the (self-appointed) job
title "documentarian".

Building a Community of Documentarians
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have a `habit <http://nodepdx.org/>`__ of
`starting <http://jsconf.cn/>`__
`conferences <http://conf.writethedocs.org>`__, as well as local
meetups, and creating terrible inside-joke-esque slang. I really enjoy
helping people organize to create the things they want to see happen.

Naturally, my first reaction to Eric Holscher's `existential
angst <https://twitter.com/ericholscher/status/287998770011074560>`__
about docs was, "Let's have a conference". I called up Eric Redmond and
we had our first meeting of documentarians (I refer to them collectively
as "the Erics").

    There exists a tribe of documentarians in the world. Up until this
    point, they haven’t had a central place to meet each other, and
    coalesce into a community. We are providing the space to allow this
    to happen, both in person and online.

The headline quote above is from a doc, then titled "`Write the Docs:
Manifesto <http://docs.writethedocs.org/about/vision/>`__\ ", written
that night. The Erics almost laughed the idea off at first; no one would
come, no one would sponsor it. I said "no really, it's not that hard,
let's see what could happen" and bought another round of beer. So, we
created a landing page with minimal details, included a call to action
and a mailing list signup form, then `posted the link to
Hacker News <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5129425>`__.

It seems we touched a nerve.

Originally, `we were discussing a 50-100 person
conference <https://twitter.com/thoward37/status/288797696939151360>`__,
mostly made up of local Portland people, probably mostly developers.
Instead, we had hundreds of signups for the mailing list in the first
day. Over the next couple months we were contacted by people from a
variety of disciplines; technical writing industry groups, designers,
typographers, literate programmers, API driven startups, and more. We
quickly `found a new
venue <http://docs.writethedocs.org/conference/venue/>`__,
and sold out a 250 person conference. The
`experience <http://adaptgather.com/2013/04/11/write-the-docs-2013/>`__
was amazing. We'd found our tribe, and they'd found us.

Now, we're ramping up for year two, with conferences both `in
Portland <http://conf.writethedocs.org/na/2014/>`__ and `in
Budapest <http://conf.writethedocs.org/eu/2014/>`__ this
spring. We've seen local meetups spring up in `San
Francisco <http://www.meetup.com/Write-the-Docs/>`__,
`Boston <https://www.meetup.com/write-the-docs-bos/>`__, and `New
York <http://www.meetup.com/Write-The-Docs-NY/>`__. We're working on
building more.

Where we are now
----------------

That was written in 2014.
Now there are over 600 attendees at Write the Docs :doc:`conferences </conf/index>` every year,
over 1,500 :doc:`meetup </meetups/index>` members that have joined meetup groups in over 15 cities.

The community keeps growing larger and larger,
and we're happy to welcome everyone into this wonderful group of documentarians.
