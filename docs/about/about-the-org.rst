Guiding Principles and Governance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our :doc:`/about-us` page describes the principles that guide us as a community organization, as well as the legal and business structure that helps us support and build the community.

The Team
~~~~~~~~

Write the Docs wouldn't be possible without our wonderful :doc:`/team`. As well as a small team of paid staff, we have volunteers who help out in the various areas of the community.

We are always looking for folks who want to take a stronger leadership role in our community. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in helping on a conference or in our community in general.

Origin Story
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're new to the community and have interest in our history, check out the :doc:`/origin-story`. You can also read about how we came to call ourselves :doc:`/documentarians`.


Code of Conduct
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We believe strongly in providing a welcoming and inclusive community. You can read our :doc:`/code-of-conduct` to better understand what we expect in our online and in-person spaces.
