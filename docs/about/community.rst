========================
Documentation Community
========================

We are bringing together a community around documentation. Communities need a `Third Place`_ to gather, and we hope to be that place. We currently have an IRC channel and mailing list for people to connect on:

    * `#writethedocs`_ on Freenode IRC
    * Write the Docs `Mailing List`_
    * Write the Docs on `Twitter`_
    * Write the Docs on `GitHub`_

Contributing
-------------

A community without people who help maintain standards and advance the state of the art isn't worth having. Write the Docs on `GitHub`_ is the place to contribute to this site and other parts of the community. If you have any wild, crazy, mundance, or old-hat ideas, we'd love to consider and appreciate them.
