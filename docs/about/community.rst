========================
Documentation Community
========================

We are bringing together a community around documentation. Communities need a `Third Place`_ to gather, and we hope to be that place. We currently have an IRC room and mailing list for people to connect on::

    * #writethedocs on Freenode IRC
    * Write the Docs Google Group

Contributing
-------------

A community without people who help maintain standards and advance the state of the art isn't worth having. `Write the Docs on GitHub`_ is the place to contribute to this site and other parts of the community. If you have any wild, crazy, mundance, or old-hat ideas, we'd love to consider and appreciate them.
