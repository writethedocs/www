Be directive
############

Let's quote `the Zen of Python`_:

* Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
* Although practicality beats purity.
* There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

How would it apply to documentation?

* documentation is the obvious place to get information.
* documentation tells the rules.
* it covers the (only) pragmatic way to go.


*******************
Don't make me think
*******************

* Sometimes users don't need to understand everything. They just want something
  that works. So give them a straightforward recipe that just works.

* Don't try to explain everything. You will become verbose. Users will feel
  bored, and if they are in some lazy mood, they may get out.

* You'd better make an user-friendly product than explain its usage in
  documentation.

* You'd better improve code readability than explain code in documentation.

* You'd better provide tools and feedback than long recipes and conventions.


****************************
Support driven documentation
****************************

* Focus on what have been proven functional. No matter if it is not perfect or
  generic. If it works, it's enough.

* Support best practices only. Refuse what breaks conventions.

* If something important is wrong with existing documentation, fix it. But
  don't spend your life supporting what has already been documented.


************
Make choices
************

Don't try to create a perfect product. You can create and maintain a sufficient
one. It's a matter of vision, priorities, choices... and iterations.

If necessary, write down those choices in the documentation.

.. note::

   The adequate place to discuss and plan choices is the ticket system (user
   stories, bugtracker), not the documentation.
