Style Guide
===========

This document specifies how we write on our websites.
It's just a start,
but everything has to start somewhere :)

Technical Formatting
--------------------

Naming conventions (files and folders)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Files and folder names should be lowercase. Names with multiple words should be separated by hyphens (-).

Links
~~~~~

If you are cross-referencing to a different page within our website, use the ``:doc:`` directive and not a hyperlink.

Website content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our website uses mostly reStructured Text (RST) markup format. We still have some legacy content in Markdown but we try to retire it whenever we encounter it.

Content
-------

Naming conventions (titles)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For page titles, or Heading1 as they are sometimes called, we use title-case.

If the page includes multiple sub-headings (H2, H3), we usually use sentence-case unless the titles include terminology that is supposed to be capitalized, such as "Writing Day".

Jargon
~~~~~~

Specialized words and jargon should be used sparingly if possible. If jargon is necessary, please define the words so your reader won't have to search out for the meaning.

Write the Docs (name in use)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are called **Write the Docs**.
The *the* is not capitalized.

We do however use the acronym **WTD**.

.. container:: good

    Good::

        I'm going to Write the Docs.
        What happened at WTD last year?

.. container:: bad

    Bad::

        I'm going to Write The Docs.
        What happened at WtD last year?

Conferences
~~~~~~~~~~~

At the beginning, there was but one *Write the Docs*.
After that, we branched out to a *North American* and *European* set of conferences.
Now, we see that there may one day be more than one conference per continent, so we started naming the events after the city.

So our 2017 conferences are officially called:

* Write the Docs Portland 2017
* Write the Docs Prague 2017


.. container:: good

    Good::

        We have some announcements about Write the Docs Portland.
        Write the Docs Portland 2017 will be held again this year.


.. container:: bad

    Bad::

       Are you going to Write the Docs North America?
       I heard that Write the Docs NA is great.

Inclusive Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gendered language should be avoided unless otherwise appropriate. And all content written for Write the Docs should be consistent with the :doc:`code of conduct. </code-of-conduct>`

Meetups
~~~~~~~

We use one word to refer to our **meetups**, and it isn't capitalized unless used in a title.

Numbers
~~~~~~~

Arabic numerals are generally used to represent numbers. Numbers 1-10 may also be spelled out. Large numbers should be separated with commas.

Abbreviations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Abbreviations should generally be defined before use, especially abbreviations related to tools specialized concepts. Definitions for common abbreviations may also be necessary if their meanings aren't easily discernible to non-native English speakers.
