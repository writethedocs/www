Write the Docs meetups and similar communities

Write the Docs brings together documentarians and tech enthusiasts through our global network of more than 20 local meetup groups as well as similar community sites.

Our meetup groups and community events are welcoming and inclusive spaces for you to learn, connect, and grow in your journey as a documentarian.

All of our organizers are volunteers local to the area or time zone that they serve. Follow these steps if you'd like to start organizing:

1. Determine if you are interested and have the capacity for this role
2. Complete the `volunteer application <https://forms.gle/Jx9CniuwEcLrEYPJ7>`__

What's in it for you?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Besides the support of the WTD organization and networking opportunities that organizing local events provide, community organizers have access to:

- Discounts for conference tickets
- Organizer-only Slack channel
- Write the Docs Zoom account for hosting virtual events
- (Coming soon) Community Organizer office hour hosted by the Meetups and Community Coordinator
- Templates

What does the community organizer role include
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Write the Docs Community Organizers plan, schedule, and run a minimum of four meetups per year for their groups. Our expectation is that you will run the group in compliance with our code of conduct and that you will act in the best interest of the group.

You are responsible for:

- Organizing a minimum of four community/meetup events per year (can be in person or virtual)
- Securing a free venue, you can partner with local businesses and organizations for this as a form of sponsorship
- Scheduling your events on meetup.com or the similar site that you are approve to use
- Creating the Zoom for virtual events and adding your event to the calendar
- Running your event (setting up, AV testing, introducing speakers, clean up)
- Communicating with the Meetups and Community coordinator as needed

Groups that do not host the minimum number of events per year will be listed as inactive. New organizers will be solicited. If new volunteers do not step forward, the group will be archived.

Organizers that do not meet these expectations, or any abuse of the role, will result in your removal from the volunteer position.

Who are we looking for?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ideal organizer is someone who is friendly with an understanding of software or similar documentation. A big part of your role is welcoming people to the group and helping them make connections with other members. 

Successful organizers know their local community well and understand their tech scene. Whether you're coming into the role with connections to your local tech scene or hoping to make them through this experience, a passion for community-building is a must!

But you're not in this alone! We encourage you to apply even if you don't think you're a perfect match. We're here to help.

Event types and formats
-----------------------

While organizers are encouraged to find speakers and presentations for their community group, we know this is not always possible.

We recognize that presentations are not the only valid form of events for our communities. Many of our WTD organizers host the following event types:

- Focused conversations: Selecting a topic or theme in advance, similar to an Unconference session
- Morning socials/coffee hours/coffee klatches: informal social gatherings, often at coffee shops or cafes, generally before work
- Lunch and learns: short presentations or focused conversations over the lunch hour
- Networking or happy hour socials: often held at local restaurants after work

Most of these events can be modified to host virtually. Some of our community organizers exclusively host virtual events. You know your local community best and you know the resources you have available. We trust you will host events that work for you and your community.

Event content guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recognize that Community Organizers may have diverse interests. Write the Docs presentations should be centered software or similar documentation. Presentations should be 15-30 minutes in length unless the event is multiple Lightning Talk presentations. Lightning Talks are 5 minute, short form presentations.

You have autonomy in selecting topics and speakers, as long as they adhere to the overarching principles:

- Focus on documentation or documentation related tools, processes, and technology
- Upskilling and/or career growth as a documentarian or adjacent roles
- All events and related materials must comply with the Write the Docs Code of Conduct

We do not allow sales pitches at our events or in messages sent to our meetup groups

FAQ
---

What am I responsible for as a Community Organizer?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A community organizer is responsible for running a Write the Docs Community or Meetup Group. It is best that this person have some documentation experience so that they can appropriately vet presentations.

As a community organizer, you will be responsible for the following with help from Meetups and Community coordinator:

- Setting a regular cadence of events (minimum of four meetups per year)
- Finding and scheduling speakers
- Securing venue space by partnering with local organizations and sponsors
- Communicating with their community members
- Upholding the Code of Conduct in all of your spaces and escalating CoC issues as needed

Where can I find speakers?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The best place to look for speakers is within your group! Send a message to your group members and ask if anyone would like to talk about a topic they are working on or a tool or process they are excited about.

If you're having trouble finding a speaker, consider a more free-form event such as:

- Focused conversations: Selecting a topic or theme in advance, similar to an Unconference session
- Morning socials/coffee hours/coffee klatches: informal social gatherings, often at coffee shops or cafes, generally before work
- Networking or happy hour socials: often held at local restaurants after work

Where can I find venues?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The best place to start your venue hunt is with what you have: Does your office allow you to book a meeting room after hours? If not, is there someone in the meetup group who's able to reserve an office space for you?

If you donâ€™t find any offices within your network, a great next step is to check out your local library, which often has a community room available you can reserve for free.

Another option is to see if a local restaurant or brewery has a quiet section where the group could meet. Accelerators and incubators (like Microsoft Reactors) or tech schools/ bootcamps are also great options.

If you can't find a physical venue, you are welcome to use the Write the Docs Meetup Zoom account to host your event virtually.

How can I schedule events and send messages on meetup.com?
