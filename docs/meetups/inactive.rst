Archived or inactive groups

We wanted to list inactive and archived Write the Docs groups to acknowledge all of the hard work
organizers and volunteers.

Groups are categorized as paused, inactive, or archived:

* **Paused groups**: A group or program that is on hiatus
* **Inactive groups**: A group that is still listed on Meetup.com but has not hosted an event in 12+ months
* **Archived groups**: A group that has been removed\* from Meetup.com

\* Archived groups may include a group that is in the process of being removed from Meetup.com.
