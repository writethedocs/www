WTD Meetup annoucements
=======================

Welcome to your meetup group updates!

Updates Aug 4, 2023
-------------------

In July we sent out a meetup activity survey to determine which groups are still active and need 
their meetup funded by Write the Docs. Here are the highlights:

* 18 organizers responded to our survey
* This allowed us to identify which groups are active and inactive
* We asked organizers if they were interested in Quorum or other time zone based group opportunities

Based on the survey results, here are our next steps:

* Create a page for inactive and archived groups
* Shutdown inactive groups and remove their information from the Active meetups sections
* Pause Quorum to research other time zone based options

With Quorum pausing, Alyssa Rock is transitioning from the Meetups Quorum lead to a general position
on the Meetups team.
