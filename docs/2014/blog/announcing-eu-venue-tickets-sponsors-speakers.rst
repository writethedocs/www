We are excited to share the latest developments on Write the Docs EU.
Prezi_ is kindly letting us use their event space for our inaugural EU event.

Along with that,
we are announcing early bird tickets,
our first speakers,
and our first sponsors.

Venue: Prezi's House of Ideas
-----------------------------

Prezi's Budapest headquarters, 
the `House of Ideas <http://retaildesignblog.net/2013/05/13/prezi-office-by-minusplus-budapest-hungary/>`_,
serves as our 2014 venue. 
The House of Ideas boasts unique architecture, 
modern design, 
and a devoted space for conferences.

Early Bird Ticket Sales
-----------------------

We try hard to keep the conference affordable,
so that everyone in the documentation world can afford to come.
With that, we are proud to announce that tickets this year are **£55**.

We are also releasing a small number of Early Bird tickets for only **£39**.
There are a limited number of Early Bird tickets. 
If you are planning to attend, 
`buy tickets`_ now!

Our First Two Speakers
----------------------

We are proud to announce our first two speakers, *Jannis Leidel* and *Kristof Van Tomme*.

Jannis Leidel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Jannis`_ works at Mozilla on the `Mozilla Developer Network`_.
MDN hosts core documentation for the web,
including canonical references for HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
He is also a core contributor to the Django web framework,
as well as many other important Open Source projects.

Kristof Van Tomme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Kristof`_ is one of the two founders of Pronovix, a Belgian Hungarian
Drupal company. At Pronovix he leads the `walkthrough`_ project, an open
source tool that turns Selenium tests into Walkthroughs: living
documentation that runs on top of your site and that tells you when it
gets broken. Previously he has also started an effort to build the
tools to work with DITA in Drupal, which might create a new role for
Drupal as an enabler of open source modular documentation.
