Announcing Write the Docs 2014
==============================

We are excited to announce the Write the Docs dates for 2014.
We had such a great time in 2013,
we have decided to expand this year.
There will be two conferences,
one in North America and one in Europe.

* Write the Docs EU in **Budapest, Hungary on March 31-April 1**.
* Write the Docs NA in **Portland, Oregon on May 5-6**.

Both of these dates are on a Monday and Tuesday.

For the uninitiated,
Write the Docs is a series of conferences focused on documentation systems,
tech writing theory, 
and information delivery.
Our conferences create a time and a place for the global community of *documentarians* to share information, 
discuss ideas, 
and work together to improve the art and science of documentation.
